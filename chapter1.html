<p><span class="tag">MERSE:</span> I apologize for interrupting, but I am Louis Merse, and I am chief
       person in charge of all matters related to monster-hunting in Flotsam.
       It is in this capacity that I must inquire if you're willing to attempt
       to resolve the problem of our so-called kayran - the beast that now
       blocks all trade traffic on the river.
<p><span class="tag">SHEALA:</span> So, witcher? Are we willing?
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I usually work alone...
<p><span class="tag">SHEALA:</span> I was here first, and I'll not relinquish this contract. My way or the
        highway, as the locals put it...
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Fine, your way it is.
<p><span class="tag">MERSE:</span> You must contact the merchants on the waterfront as regards any rewards.
        Madame De Tansarville has, I believe, already conducted some
        preliminary negotiations...
<p><span class="tag">SHEALA:</span> That, I have.
<p><span class="tag">MERSE:</span> In that case, don't let me keep you.

<p><span class="tag">SHEALA:</span> Triss, how long must I wait for you to introduce us?
<p><span class="tag">TRISS:</span> Síle de Tansarville, advisor to Queen Zulika of Kovir.
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Kovir's a long way north.
<p><span class="tag">SHEALA:</span> True. I had my doubts if the kayran was worth the journey, but those
        were dispelled with what it showed today.
<p><span class="tag">TRISS:</span> Here to hunt down some ingredients?
<p><span class="tag">SHEALA:</span> Triss Merigold - sharp as ever.
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> You're thinking that...?
<p><span class="tag">SHEALA:</span> Troll eyes, ghoul venom, virgins' blood... All those disgusting
        marvels we take from dying species... To throw into the cauldron at
        sabbaths. Right, Triss?
<p><span class="tag">TRISS:</span> Absolutely - virgins are a dying breed.
<p><span class="tag">SHEALA:</span> Oh my! Your sense of humor seems to be intact, too. But enough of
        these pleasantries. Tell me, <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> you saw the tentacle - what do
        you make of it all?
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> The beast must be huge. Maybe inhabited one of the Pontar's tributaries
        before, hunting animals... Then it grew for some reason and hunger
        drove it to seek fresh pastures.
<p><span class="tag">SHEALA:</span> And on the Pontar it found trade barges burgeoning with obese,
        slow-moving merchants. You're partly correct. Cedric claims the
        kayran emerged from the northern swamps approximately one month past.

<div class="dialogue">
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I need to look around, find out a few things...
<p><span class="tag">SHEALA:</span> Hm, an investigation, witchers' rituals, extracting secrets and such...
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> More or less. I'll talk to the merchants about the reward, pay Cedric
        a visit and get back to you...
<p><span class="tag">SHEALA:</span> You'll find me at the inn. I've rented lodgings there - on the upper
        floor.
<p><span class="tag">TRISS:</span> You know the inn's also a whorehouse.
<p><span class="tag">SHEALA:</span> Thanks for the warning.
