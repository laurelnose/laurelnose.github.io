    "content": "CONTENTS NEXT &gt; DANDELION: I never thought some local swill in some faraway hole could taste so good. The world looks different from atop a scaffold, lemme tell ya. But risks come with the job. GERALT: Right, poetry's a risky business. DANDELION: Laugh all you want, Geralt, but I'm talking about the daily dilemmas of a secret agent of His Royal Majesty. GERALT: Did Roche recruit you? DANDELION: I travel as a matter of course, and the crown pays me well for information from neighboring kingdoms. Let's just say I've placed my personal safety as a sacrifice on the altar of my motherland. GERALT: Will you ever learn? You're no good at this. Are you even Temerian? DANDELION: I put my talents to the best possible use. And money, my friend, don't stink. Besides, if I tried to back out now, they'd probably arrest and hang me. Talk. I can tell you want to. GERALT: I know you - I can see you're dying to ask me. What is it? DANDELION: All right, fess up. What happened to Foltest? He pissed off the Scoia'tael. GERALT: The King's dead, and the Scoia'tael are in it up to the tips of their pointed ears. DANDELION: Yada, yada. The Scoia'tael are blamed for everything in this country, from bad crops to bad marital sex. GERALT: I was there. I saw it. The assassin escaped with the help of Scoia'tael. DANDELION: Hm, I guess the price on Iorveth's head will rise. GERALT: Loredo's sensed that already. If he can catch Iorveth... DANDELION: Fertilized by the elf's rotting corpse, his career will blossom, somewhere far away from this dump. I was framed. GERALT: Want to know the version that has yet to make it to Flotsam? The King died in mysterious circumstances. The witcher Geralt, his sword covered in blood, was discovered standing over his corpse. DANDELION: Did you kill him? This'll stay between us, I promise... GERALT: The killer escaped before I could get him. I'm being set up. DANDELION: So what're you gonna do? Run around, swinging your sword, hoping the killer walks into range? GERALT: I don't have to. The killer's in the forest with the Scoia'tael, and he knows I'm here. We'll find each other. DANDELION: Geralt, please don't do anything stupid. Don't stick your neck out. If Loredo finds out you were involved in Foltest's assassination... Ugh. What did you put in that report you gave Roche? GERALT: You gave Vernon a full report on Flotsam. Seen anything unusual around here? DANDELION: They've got some amazing women at the brothel - you should take a look. One of them... GERALT: You know what I mean. DANDELION: A town like any other. It's got a harbor, an inn and a stinking, muddy river. That's what an ordinary man would say. But we poets also look into people's souls. And things are not good. I saw a robbery sanctioned by law, town watchmen laughing as they \"confiscated\" goods, all the while talking about how they'd finally bring order to the town. I saw drunken thugs beat up an elf woman while no one even flinched. DANDELION: I know these things happen everywhere, but here, it's not motivated by hatred or misguided attempts at meting out justice. People are driven by cold calculation. They're always looking for opportunities to get a little richer. Have you learned anything about the assassinations? GERALT: I need information, anything that could help me track down the kingslayers. DANDELION: I only know gossip - things folk have been saying since Demavend's death. People are throwing out blame left and right. One day it's the elves, another the Nilfgaardians, then it's Rivians... GERALT: Lemme guess - the suspects also include a Zerrikanian alchemist. And a group of halflings... DANDELION: Bold theory, that, but the mob comes up with even better ones. Know what? Frankly, the most worrying effect of these assassinations is the chaos they've unleashed in people's minds. GERALT: What do you mean? DANDELION: I mean chaos. People don't know what to think - who's good and who's evil. And these are tough times. Who knows what's going to happen. So, master spy, politics - care to give me your assessment? GERALT: So, mister master spy, what's new in the world of politics? Bards singing about anything interesting these days? DANDELION: Aedirn's in trouble. Henselt and his great army are nearing the Pontar and will ford it and strike any day. GERALT: Well, we haven't had a war in a long time. DANDELION: Like all little boys, he likes to play with his soldiers. But I don't think Kaedwen'll have an easy time of it. Aedirn's borders are guarded by Saskia the Dragonslayer. GERALT: Who's she? Some mercenary? DANDELION: A peasant girl and self-proclaimed commander of something called the Aedirnian Voluntary Militia. GERALT: Fighting women and bards who play politics. These are strange times... My memory's coming back. GERALT: I'm having flashbacks, Dandelion. DANDELION: What've you remembered? GERALT: My own death. DANDELION: I saw that with my own eyes, as I've told you many times. Yennefer gave her life to save yours. I thought you might've remembered what happened afterwards. I mean, how the devil can you be here now? I hear you, I see you... You're breathing, I mean, you're just alive. GERALT: Dandelion, I've had a flashback or two. I don't know everything yet. I found a manuscript about the Wild Hunt. GERALT: The Wild Hunt's not a legend - I can prove it. DANDELION: How so? GERALT: I found a manuscript whose authors contend that our world is not the only one where there's life. They also believe stars are not just twinkling points. DANDELION: You want to tell me that somewhere up there, I'd find other Geralts, other Dandelions, living, breathing and...? Shame we can't meet up. GERALT: Exactly. The manuscript says vast distances are the main problem - a normal human would run out of lifetime before he got to any of those other worlds. DANDELION: Besides which he'd have to have something that could fly. GERALT: The manuscript's authors claims the Wild Hunt has found solutions to both problems. The cavalcade travels between the worlds. DANDELION: Sounds a little like the ravings of a drunk dwarf, but who knows... GERALT: I need to find out. The manuscript mentions someone named Morten Collis, who devoted his life to observing the Hunt. Maybe I can get my hands on his research. I've been to the Isle of Avallach. GERALT: I now remember the Isle of Avallach, where Ciri took Yennefer and me... It was a joyous time... Until the Wild Hunt's riders appeared. They abducted Yennefer... DANDELION: Sure you didn't dream this? GERALT: I dream of the Wild Hunt every night. But these were not illusions, hallucinations. DANDELION: I'm not sure how to help you. There must've been someone who studied the Wild Hunt, though from what I can remember, human literature is pretty much silent about it, . There's always elven literature - I don't know that too well, so maybe it's worth some delving... ",

    "content": "&lt; PREV CONTENTS NEXT &gt; ROCHE: What's going on, Geralt? [If Geralt hasn't gone to Loredo's compound] What now? Got a plan? GERALT: We arrived in Flotsam, we saw the killer, we've pissed everyone off. What next? ROCHE: If the kingslayer's in Iorveth's care, we'll have to get them both. GERALT: If we go out into that forest to look for elves, all we'll find is our own death. ROCHE: We'll visit Loredo as invited. He may be a hick heading a bunch of imbeciles, but this is his territory and he could prove useful. We're wasting time. The kingslayer will escape. GERALT: You'll get a chance to show your mettle. If we're to capture Foltest's murderer, we'll have to clash with the Scoia'tael. ROCHE: I sent the boys out into the woods. Tough going, too dense. My scouts got ambushed and barely escaped. GERALT: It's no picnic hunting elves in the forest - tell me something I don't know. ROCHE: My people saw the kingslayer again. He knows we're here but he's not even trying to escape. Seems he's waiting for something. GERALT: I think it's our move. Looks like you're on Loredo's shit list. GERALT: How can the commander of a Temerian garrison just piss all over the commander of Foltest's special forces? ROCHE: The Blue Stripes aren't exactly popular among common folk, in case you hadn't noticed. GERALT: Like anyone who does the dirty work. But Loredo's a soldier... ROCHE: The worst scum gets posted to dumpy border towns like this. Incompetent fools who show off their authority to a bunch of grimy peasants. Loredo's up to something big. GERALT: Loredo wants the Scoia'tael gone for good. He didn't say anything specific, but in his mind's eye he saw them on the prison barge already. ROCHE: Iorveth's outsmarted bigger fish than the commandant. GERALT: Loredo's got something going with Síle, so I'd take him seriously if I were you. ROCHE: You never know, maybe the sorceress hunts more than monsters. I spoke to Iorveth's deputy commander. GERALT: I questioned Ciaran, Iorveth's second in command. ROCHE: Where is the bastard? GERALT: I get the feeling he's dead, just landed on the Isle of Avallach. I've been to that island, Vernon. I remembered something while talking to Ciaran. I was there with Yennefer. She gave her life to save mine. ROCHE: Did you remember the crossing, how you got there? GERALT: With Ciri's help... ROCHE: Interesting... GERALT: What I find interesting is how a master spook like you has no idea what happened to me over those five years. Five years, Roche. That's enough time to topple a monarchy, twice. ROCHE: First off, my responsibilities do not include the surveillance of dead witchers. And second... GERALT: Spit it out. ROCHE: Unconfirmed rumors - I've never taken action based on them. GERALT: I need something, scraps even. So you need to tell me everything you know. Even things you think might sound ridiculous. ROCHE: Three years back, Fenn got a missing persons case. Someone was abducting young people, aged ten to twenty. Ugh, the case went cold because no one agreed to testify. Except for one woman, considered insane because she insisted the Wild Hunt had made off with her son. And she claimed she'd learned of this from an old man who was pursuing the cavalcade. He resembled a skeleton more than a man - white hair, two swords on his back. GERALT: The Wild Hunt is a riddle. A riddle that will restore my memory - if I can just solve it. ROCHE: As I see it, you're more likely to learn about the Hunt from the insane. Not a reasonable man out there can teach you a thing. You might visit that asylum in the woods - or what's left of it. [If Cedric is dead] GERALT: Recovering my memory - that's in your interest, too. ROCHE: I'll never fall for that - too simple. GERALT: Before he died, Cedric told me that once I'd recovered my memory, I'd understand who was behind the royal slayings. Including that of your king, Roche. ROCHE: The ravings of a drunken elf. GERALT: Sorry you see it that way. I found a patient's chart. GERALT: I found a patient's chart in the ruins of the hospital. ROCHE: You mean the burned down insane asylum? GERALT: They committed him to the asylum because he had insisted he'd been a prisoner of the Wild Hunt. He claimed he'd been in a world without humans, where he'd seen herds of unicorns. He managed to return to our world after a year, only to find his children had died of old age... Following this, Vernon? It means he'd been to a world where time flows a lot slower... I have the notes of a madman who claimed he'd been abducted by the Hunt. [Same as \"I found a patient's chart\" above.] Flotsam's in the wilderness. It's a good hideout. GERALT: A little town deep in the forest, terrorized by Scoia'tael. You should be in your element, Roche. ROCHE: Flotsam isn't just any old town, Geralt. Temeria, Redania, Kaedwen and Aedirn - the largest kingdoms in the North. Know what they all have in common? GERALT: The Pontar Valley. A strip of land they've been battling over for generations. ROCHE: Exactly. And here's Flotsam. On the border between Temeria and Aedirn, with Kaedwen lying in wait just the other side of the marshes. GERALT: At the very edge of the Pontar Valley. ROCHE: Stuck in the middle like a candle up the arse. GERALT: The North's most important trade routes meet here. Every caravan has to come through Flotsam, and anyone who wants to place their cargo on a boat on this section of the river has to bear Loredo in mind. ROCHE: They say Henselt of Kaedwen has gathered an army and is heading for Vergen. The Pontar Valley will be on fire soon. While we, Geralt, are sitting in Flotsam, the gateway to the valley. GERALT: I'd like to believe it's pure coincidence and the killer just followed the Squirrels here. ROCHE: Naïve, to say the least, witcher. [EXIT] See you later. GERALT: So long, Roche. ",

I know every shit joke that anyone's ever thought up, plus I've learned how to burp out the official title of the Emperor of Nilfgaard without reaching for beer. TRISS: Shorty's told me about his sixteen children - all named after Temerian troop divisions - and I know his nickname has nothing to do with his manhood. Nice to know you that you care, though. GERALT: Glad to see you in a good mood. TRISS: I think I actually like them. They're good people. One of them even proposed to me. GERALT: Who's the brave man? TRISS: Hm, sorry, that's a secret. GERALT: And here I thought Roche's boys had an ounce of respect for me. [If kayran is alive] Are you scared of De Tansarville? GERALT: Did you go pale when you saw Síle or did I imagine that? TRISS: I don't like her. GERALT: It's that simple...? TRISS: She has no human feelings, she's cold, ruthless and painfully logical. She once forced me to make a decision I regret to this day. GERALT: I need her help to kill the kayran. Then she'll go her way, and we'll go ours. TRISS: I hope so. Watch out for yourself in the meantime. GERALT: Don't worry, wild beasts are my specialty. TRISS: Not sorceresses? GERALT: Same thing. [If kayran is alive] Can you help me with the kayran? GERALT: If you helped me draw the kayran out of the water, I wouldn't have to ask Síle. TRISS: I don't know the right spells. I've never dealt with monsters. TRISS: Geralt, couldn't you just leave this one monster alone? There must be some other way to rip Dandelion and Zoltan out of Loredo's hands. GERALT: Wait a second... What is it, Triss? She's just one more conceited sorceress. TRISS: Sorry, I'm not sure myself... I've got a feeling I've been deceived and manipulated by sorceresses I trust. Is Síle one of those sorceresses? GERALT: Is Síle one of them? TRISS: I think so, but I can't be certain. TRISS: It's complicated, Geralt. I need some time. Want to tell me something? GERALT: You want to talk or not? TRISS: No... Yes... Oh, I don't know. I need some time. GERALT: You have a think, and I'll deal with the kayran. Seems my memory's coming back. GERALT: The massacre in Rivia - it came back to me, I remember. The angry mob murdering nonhumans, a young boy with a pitchfork. TRISS: Anything else? GERALT: Death... Or a state close to it, I'm not sure. I felt life draining out of me. TRISS: Um, I was there. I arrived a moment later, too late... GERALT: Don't worry, Triss. They're only memories. We have bigger problems to tackle, now. Something tells me that in recovering my memory, I'll find out a lot about what we're dealing with now. ",

GERALT: Well, you're a beautiful girl and... VES: So what? I'm not a nobleman's or merchant's daughter. All right, I may have the looks, but with my background, the best I could hope for was to be a maid in some roadside inn. Or to work at a brothel not unlike the local one, using my sweet lips to give blowjobs for a handful of coppers. VES: So I'll stick to slitting elven throats, thank you. I'd probably do the same. GERALT: Definitely the better choice, if you look at it that way. They say you're good at it. VES: Right you are. VES: I'm a soldier because I do it well. GERALT: Ever dreamed of a different life? VES: Finch, our marksman, once tried farming. But he just didn't have the hands for it. GERALT: Bet he'd get me right between the eyes from eighty paces off. VES: A hundred. I've tried cooking, darning, smiling like a doll, serving beer in a tavern. None are my thing. I want you to know that I like you. GERALT: You know what you want and I like that. VES: You're quick to pounce, witcher. Except you've got the wrong girl. Why? GERALT: You think so? VES: All right, Roche has decided you're sailing with us. Fine. But it wouldn't be the best time even if I fancied you, which I don't. VES: I need your sword, not your dick. Anyway, as far as I know, you're hardly indifferent to Triss Merigold. You're right. GERALT: Well said. VES: She has spaniel eyes whenever you're around. It's hard not to notice. What does that change? GERALT: Does that bother you? VES: I don't care, but I'm not about to mess with a sorceress. It's nothing important. GERALT: We're not as close as you think. VES: I wonder if she feels the same. VES: I don't care, but I'm not about to mess with a sorceress. Forget it, see you. GERALT: Oh, forget it. VES: I already have. That’s the way I like it. GERALT: I like naughty girls. VES: Really? But Triss seems so sweet. VES: All right, Roche has decided you're sailing with us. Fine. But it wouldn't be the best time even if I fancied you, which I don't. VES: I need your sword, not your dick. Anyway, as far as I know, you're hardly indifferent to Triss Merigold. You've got it wrong. GERALT: You misunderstood me. I'm just glad we're on the same side. VES: Me, too. Say 'hi' to Triss for me. I like to know who I'm working with. GERALT: I have trust issues. I like to know who's covering my ass. VES: No need to worry, witcher. I'm good at what I do. [PERSUASION] Seems to me you're pretending to be someone you're not... GERALT: Do I see a sensitive little girl hiding behind a mask of indifference? [FAILURE] VES: You'd like that, wouldn't you? Poor Ves... VES: Sorry. That little girl is not me. [SUCCESS] VES: I wouldn't be here if you were right. VES: I was raised in a small village where people cared about two things only: if the drought was going to destroy their crops... and if the Scoia'tael would appear in the local woods... VES: One day, a large Scoia'tael unit appeared. They burned the village to the ground and slaughtered all the inhabitants. I alone survived because their commander, the bastard, fancied me. VES: They dragged me around with them for months. I knew they'd kill me once they tired of me. And then Vernon turned up. GERALT: Did he draft you into service? VES: He taught me everything I know. In time, I realized my place was with the Blue Stripes. [Continues same as \"VES: I'm a soldier because I do it well.\"] The kingslayer isn't any old Scoia'tael. GERALT: The man we're looking for is much more dangerous than any Scoia'tael. VES: Must be, if he managed to outwit Geralt of Rivia. GERALT: It wasn't the first time someone tried to kill Foltest. I killed an assassin before. That means there could be more assassins out there. VES: If anyone screws up, it won't be me, I assure you. I'm sure it's an interesting story. GERALT: You don't end up in a unit fighting nonhumans by accident. You must have an interesting story to tell. VES: Why should I tell it to you, of all people? I like to know who I'm working with. [Same as above.] [PERSUASION] Seems to me you're pretending to be someone you're not... [Same as above.] I like you. [Same as \"I want you to know that I like you.\"] Never mind, see you. [Same as \"Forget it, see you.\"] [After asking this question once] GERALT: Do I have this right? Your father was called up but he was old, so you stole his armor and took his place? VES: I wish I had. But I never knew my father. Do you like it here in Flotsam? GERALT: Nice area, isn't it? VES: I prefer these little towns, forgotten by gods and people alike, to palaces and castles. It's survival of the fittest here. At least you know what to expect. VES: So, yes, I like it here. Why do you kill nonhumans? GERALT: Is your hatred towards the Scoia'tael some sort of revenge? VES: You don't know me, Geralt. Human or nonhuman - it makes no difference to me. We were chosen to fight the Scoia'tael, and that's the mission we pursue. To me, the Scoia'tael are but bandits hiding out in the woods. If there were humans among them, I'd kill them in a flash just the same. ",

Requires precision, but it's well-paid work. GERALT: Jewelry? ZOLTAN: Not quite. The sorceress is building a magical contraption. Spends her days staring at it - a regular magpie eyeing a copper. But I don't think she's gettin' anywhere with it. Got so enraged one time she dashed a vase against the wall. Some temperament, those sorceresses, I'm telling you. I need new weapons. GERALT: Is there a good sword smith or blacksmith here? ZOLTAN: There's a small smithy by the wall. Quite basic. The tools probably remember the Conjunction of the Spheres, but it'll do for weapon repairs. They also enhance swords with runes and add ornamentation to armor. Just don't do anything that'll make you look like Dandelion at the opening of a new brothel. You could also look in on some merchants. I don't think Loredo's robbed them of everything yet. [Before meeting Cedric] Heard of an elf named Cedric? GERALT: Do you know someone named Cedric? ZOLTAN: Know him? We drank each other under the table last Saturday. I barely made it home. GERALT: Where do I find him? ZOLTAN: Ah, most times, gazing at the forest from a tower near Lobinden. Strange bird, that one, but a heavyweight when it comes to drink. GERALT: Thanks... [After An Indecent Proposal] I know Loredo's plans. GERALT: I spoke to the Commandant. The future hardly looks bright for the nonhumans in Flotsam. ZOLTAN: That fucker's only waiting for an excuse. One small provocation by Iorveth and he'll attack us. GERALT: How do you know? ZOLTAN: Heard it by chance. Saw him walking through the port one night, talking to himself, the batty bastard. He mentioned a new order and a world for humans only. He laughed and shouted curses at the prison barge. The scum is up to something. Iorveth must sense it. He's doing everything not to provoke Loredo, but his Scoia'tael might have a different opinion. And less restraint. [After fighting Letho] Heard anything interesting recently? GERALT: Any news? ZOLTAN: Triss has sniffed something out. Apparently, there are prisoners on the barge in the port. Squirrels, no less. ",

Fundamentally a trader in old curios, although I also concern myself with the nonhuman community. Books in Flotsam? GERALT: Books in Flotsam? I wouldn't have thought it a profitable enterprise. EINAR: Heh, many foreigners come through here. Sometimes they buy books, sometimes they have tomes to sell. Yesterday, for example, Lady Síle de Tansarville purchased items for a sum equal to my yearly dealings. GERALT: Did she buy anything interesting? EINAR: \"De Vermis Mysteriis,\" \"The Exeter Treaties,\" complete and unabridged, plus a very expensive volume I'd rather not mention. I should add - as generosity must be praised - that she made a donation to the community. Specifically to the fund for widows and orphans. The nonhuman community... GERALT: The nonhumans in Flotsam are organized? EINAR: We aren't. But we aid each other as best we can. I mainly collect taxes and announce the Commandant's dispositions. GERALT: That'd make you a prime target for Iorveth. EINAR: Heh, heh, you're correct on that account. He's warned me many times, and I've explained the need for my function to him just as many. Both in vain - it seems we've agreed to disagree. Well, the sword is his calling, the pen is mine, hence no meeting of the minds. EINAR: It wasn't always this hard. Turned sour when several elven lasses disappeared. We lost our trust in the humans, and the Scoia'tael ceased trusting us. GERALT: Did they turn up? The women? EINAR: No. I believe nekkers killed them... I remember Moril of the white hands... She and her lover made a beautiful pair... Godspeed. [EXIT] EINAR: Godspeed. ",

CHORAB: Everybody here? Sitting comfortably? Then listen... CHORAB: Not so long ago, our King Foltest had a daughter named Adda. The girl died, but an evil man cursed her and wouldn't let her rest in peace. CHORAB: Adda was reborn as a striga. She left her sarcophagus at night and, hungry for human flesh, hunted on Vizima's streets. CHORAB: The city was frozen with fear, and the King promised a reward for lifting the curse from his daughter. Many tried, but they all failed. CHORAB: Then a witcher came to Vizima. He heard people out, examined wounds left by the striga's talons, and accepted the job, despite many warnings. CHORAB: The witcher fought the beast the whole night. He led her on, dodged her fangs, and parried her furious attacks. Though he was close to death, he didn't want to kill her. CHORAB: This was the first time the striga saw such fierceness in a man. She felt the strength of his iron will and backed down. CHORAB: Witchers know how to dispel enchantments and spells like nobody else. That brave soul also knew how to lift the curse. CHORAB: He sealed himself in the striga's sarcophagus, beside her mother's corpse, and waited for morning. The third cock-crow lifted the evil spell and turned the striga back into a princess. CHORAB: However, the curse was not dispelled immediately. The witcher nearly died, attacked by the beast in girl's form. CHORAB: The King's men found him, bleeding. They also found the princess, cured, but still feeble of mind. CHORAB: That's how Foltest regained his daughter. Such things do happen under the sun and the moon. CHORAB: Today I'll tell ye how Lobinden came to be. CHORAB: A long time ago, our forefathers came to this shore. The King granted them land, on the condition they clear the forest. CHORAB: Back then, like now, the wilderness was a dark, dreadful place. But our forefathers wanted to settle here badly. CHORAB: They spent their nights on their riverboat. From the deck they could hear the Old Man and the howling of werewolves. During the day, they tried to clear the forest with fire and axe. CHORAB: The trees, however, were too large and too tough for Aedirnian steel. And the forest responded to fire by sending ever deadlier nightmares from its depths. CHORAB: A priestess came here with the settlers. A wise woman, who finally said that this land belonged to no man, and would never submit to man. CHORAB: The priestess led the men deep into the forest and showed them the altar of the old god Veyopatis. All understood this land would never belong to them and they could only settle its edge at best. CHORAB: Our forefathers bowed before Veyopatis and offered him sacrifice, and he protected them from the forest and gave them the river rich in fish. CHORAB: They posted poles in the forest, to forever mark the boundary between the human and that which be not. CHORAB: That is how it was, is, and will yet be. ",

    "content": "CONTENTS NEXT &gt; [In the lower floor of the tavern, Geralt finds some fistfighters. He talks to the organizer, a man named Sheridan.] . GERALT: What's going on here? SHERIDAN: A competition, brother! With the port closed, we're bored off our arses. Care to take part? GERALT: What're the rules? SHERIDAN: The contenders put their coin down. Winner takes all. GERALT: The fighting rules. SHERIDAN: Drop your opponent and make sure he stays down. GERALT: Complicated... SHERIDAN: So? Are you fighting, brother? Not now. GERALT: Some other time. I'll give it a shot. GERALT: Oh, yeah. SHERIDAN: He's a fresher like you, brother. Good for starters. Put your coin down! So, what'll it be? GERALT: I'm ready. SHERIDAN: Gentlemen! Let the dance begin! [If Geralt fails to beat a boxer at any point] SHERIDAN: Your mug looks like a pig's liver, brother. And you lost your coin, but better luck next time. [If Geralt beats the first boxer] SHERIDAN: That was fucking poetry! Up for another, brother? GERALT: Who's up next? SHERIDAN: Kcorb Ransel, known as Fliparse. GERALT: Strange name. SHERIDAN: Does everything backwards. Sleeps in daytime, drinks before he eats, and tells women to get dressed before he ploughs 'em. GERALT: Fliparse... SHERIDAN: Show us your orens. [After Geralt beats Fliparse, a man calls Geralt over.] ZIGGY: Hey champ! GERALT: What? ZIGGY: I can tell you're a serious contender, far too good for this drunken riff-raff. Believe you me, I know what I'm talking about. GERALT: So? I don't know you. ZIGGY: They call me King Ziggy. Because I pay like a king. If you want a taste of fame and riches, look for me by the inn in the evenings. I'll take you to the right place. SHERIDAN: Wouldn't want to get on your bad side. Up for another, brother? GERALT: Who's up next? SHERIDAN: I knew you'd end up fighting each other! GERALT: Who's that? SHERIDAN: Tidy Tib. The bastard eats honey straight from the hive, drinks for four, and some say he can hang a bucket full of water from his cock. You better get a solid coin pouch ready! [Geralt beats Tib.] SHERIDAN: Congratulations! You dropped some of the toughest brawlers! Well done! Tournament's over. [Geralt meets King Ziggy outside the tavern at night.] ZIGGY: Who does King Ziggy behold? ZIGGY: Given any thought to my proposal? Fill me in. GERALT: Gimme the details. ZIGGY: Only once you've made your mind up, my friend. For now, you'll have to make do with the lure of fame and coin. Or, you can going on wasting your talents beating the dust out of drunkards around the inns. ZIGGY: Whaddaya say? Yeah, let's go. GERALT: I'm ready. ZIGGY: I'll explain on the way. No. GERALT: I've got a crapload to do, Ziggy. ZIGGY: If you change your mind, you know where to find me. [Geralt follows Ziggy.] GERALT: Spit it out. ZIGGY: Know what Flotsam's famous for? GERALT: Nothing? ZIGGY: You're wrong, there. There are only two towns worth visiting in the Pontar Valley. Bondar, famous for having the most beautiful whores in the North, and Flotsam, for having the best fist fighting scene. GERALT: Who organizes these fights? ZIGGY: Officially, no one. But look hard, and you'll be surprised what you can find. It's a vibrant scene with winners and losers of all kinds. I promote fighters, place them in tournaments. Singled you out and venture to say you'll not regret that. ZIGGY: Now, let's go where boys become men and brawlers become champions. The place reeks of blood, but come out standing and you'll sense the sweet smell of orens. [They come to the gate of Loredo's compound.] GUARD: Halt! ZIGGY: Don't recognize King Ziggy? GUARD: I know you, but who's the other one? He looks dangerous. ZIGGY: Like all of King Ziggy's fighters. GUARD: Well that farmhand you brought in last time was carried out all broken in no time. ZIGGY: This one will be different. You'll see. The Commandant himself will bet a fortune on him. GUARD: All right, but if I'm to let him in he has to leave all his weapons here. No way. GERALT: Find another fool, Ziggy. ZIGGY: Why?! I'm givin' you the greatest chance of your life, and you're the biggest fool in the world if you don't take it. GERALT: Oh, dear... I'd best go drown my sorrows. I'm in. GERALT: Fine. ZIGGY: You're a rich man already! GUARD: The weapons will be waiting in the trunk outside the gate. [They enter the compound.] GERALT: Loredo... ZIGGY: In the flesh. GERALT: Does he condone these fights? ZIGGY: Condone? He sets them up. A lot of coin at stake here. I haven't been too lucky lately, but I believe you'll change that. People will remember King Ziggy! Just don't disappoint me. GERALT: Mhm. [They head into the yard behind Loredo's house and down into an underground bunker where a boxing ring has been set up.] LOREDO: Ziggy the Clown returns! ZIGGY: And in grand fashion! I've got a contender who's about to be famous. LOREDO: The monster slayer?! How'd you talk him into fighting? ZIGGY: King Ziggy has his ways. LOREDO: All in all, looks promising... ZIGGY: We're about to make Flotsam famous for its mug fights! They'll sing songs about Ziggy and Geralt. You just win and I'll take care of the rest. Ready? I've had enough of this malarkey. GERALT: This isn't my game. ZIGGY: You promised to fight! What are you - a woman on her lunar cycle? Aww - get outta my sight! The guards'll take you to the gate. I want to fight. GERALT: Yeah, I'm ready. ZIGGY: Grand! I'll hear you say my name with reverence yet! ZIGGY: Twigs'll be your first opponent. So-called because bones snap with his every punch. GERALT: I love these pussies with cocky names. [Geralt beats Twigs.] ZIGGY: Beautiful job rearranging his face! GERALT: Who's next? ZIGGY: One–Punch Matho. Name says it all. Downs most opponents with his first punch. GERALT: I'll see if I can't make him throw a second. ZIGGY: Good luck! [Geralt beats Matho.] ZIGGY: You're the discovery of my lifetime. GERALT: Think we're made for each other? ZIGGY: Indeed! But we've a long way to go. Your next opponent is Smugface, also known as Tassledick. GERALT: Not too popular, then? ZIGGY: He has tassels on his clothes. Last month he bit his opponent's ear off. GERALT: Bring on this Tassledick. [Geralt beats Tassledick.] ZIGGY: One more and we'll be rich and famous. GERALT: Who is it? ZIGGY: Zdenek. In a rumble, it takes at least four lads to take him down. [If no Witcher 1 save was imported, or you didn't meet Zdenek] GERALT: I'll do it single-handed. ZIGGY: Don't underestimate him. [If you met Zdenek in Witcher 1] GERALT: I know him. ZIGGY: How? GERALT: I fought him. ZIGGY: And...? [If you didn't beat him] GERALT: I lost. ZIGGY: Shit. That's it, then. GERALT: Not necessarily. I'll give it another shot. We'll see if I was the weakling or he was the strongman. [If you beat him] GERALT: I won. ZIGGY: Grand! Looks like Zdenek's in for a beating. GERALT: You never know. [Before Geralt can fight Zdenek, Loredo calls him over.] . LOREDO: Witcher, come here a minute. LOREDO: Impressive technique... GERALT: Thanks. LOREDO: Last fight's coming up and everyone's betting on the dead cert - you. Except for me. GERALT: What do you want, Loredo? LOREDO: Zdenek has to win. But the true winners will be you and me. A third of the jackpot's yours. And that's not an offer. I'll do it. GERALT: 50/50 split. LOREDO: Fine - to show you my heart of gold. Just don't fail me. And I'm not a conman. GERALT: I see. You're a regular con. LOREDO: Your opinions don't interest me. You're to take a dive. That's that. GERALT: Piss off, old man. [Geralt fights Zdenek.] GERALT: Pay up. LOREDO: Here's your coin. The guards'll take you to the gate. LOREDO: You'll regret this. ZIGGY: I told you we'd win! I've got a real sense for these things. GERALT: I think you owe me something. ZIGGY: Why don't we have some fun, first? A free round at every inn, not to mention the girls. GERALT: You can screw my share. [Later, a pair of bandits can be encountered in Flotsam, who Geralt must fight off.] BANDIT: Commandant Loredo sends his regards, punk. [If Geralt loses any match, Loredo has his guards throw Geralt out of the compound.] LOREDO: Shit belongs in the gutter. GUARD: Aye, s-sir! [If you agreed to throw the fight with Zdenek] LOREDO: I appreciate courage. But I appreciate common sense even more. [After a second, Dandelion shows up.] [If you lost a match] DANDELION: Those peasants beat you like a dog... GERALT: I guess I let them... Wait, h-how would you know? DANDELION: I like to bet on a good knuckle fight once in a while. How do you feel? GERALT: As if I just got run over by a cavalry regiment. DANDELION: Hm, just like me. GERALT: Did they beat you up, too? DANDELION: Worse. They've got this small kayran they keep in a glass jar. It predicts fight results. Apparently had a perfect record... until today, that is. It indicated you with one its tentacles, so that's how I bet all my coin. [If you agreed to throw the fight with Zdenek] DANDELION: Geralt! GERALT: Keep your voice down. DANDELION: I'm in trouble. GERALT: Nah, you? DANDELION: I know you. I've seen you fight. What the hell was that? I mean, even the little kayran they keep here to predict fight results indicated you with its tentacle. DANDELION: I bet all my orens on you. And you went down as if someone had tied your balls in a knot just before the fight. GERALT: Balls are something I might be lacking entirely. Let's go have a drink, Dandelion. I'm buying. ",

GERALT: I don't like sadists. VES: Vernon was a half-orphan... GERALT: What does that have to do with it? VES: He was raised in poverty. His mother turned to whoring to keep them from starving.

[Geralt passes out and awakes naked on the riverbank.] VILLAGER: Got drunk as newts, you did. Never seen anything like it in my life. GERALT: Anything like what? VILLAGER: Such a sight. GERALT: Meaning? VILLAGER: Better you don't remember. GERALT: But I wanna know. VILLAGER: I'd tell you for a few orens. [BRIBE] Here... [Not enough coins] VILLAGER: You can do better than that, surely. [SUCCESS] GERALT: There. Now talk. [INTIMIDATION] Start talking or else... [FAILURE] GERALT: Speak if you don't want to get hit. VILLAGER: Not just drunk, but uncouth, too. [SUCCESS] GERALT: Listen. I'm a witcher and I'm massively hung over right now. So speak, or regret it. VILLAGER: All right, then. VILLAGER: Talk to the madame. She knows the details. [Geralt goes to see Margot in the brothel.] GERALT: Greetings. MARGOT: What can I get you, fine lad? What happened here yesterday? I can't remember a thing. GERALT: They say you know what happened here yesterday. MARGOT: I do. But you'd be better off not askin', darlin'. GERALT: Talk. MARGOT: Nothin's for free. Especially in a brothel. I'll pay. [Not enough coin] GERALT: Maybe another time, then. MARGOT: See you again. [SUCCESS] GERALT: All right. Talk. MARGOT: Five of you came in, or crawled in, I should say... GERALT: I was crawling? MARGOT: Indeed! One of the blue ones ordered five girls. I gave you the best 'cos you showed me good coin. GERALT: What happened next? MARGOT: This is the interesting bit, 'cos instead of ploughing them like the normal soldiery, you mounted 'em and told 'em to give you a ride to the port. GERALT: Can't be... MARGOT: Ask the lass in the uniform, then. GERALT: Ves was here, too? MARGOT: Sure was... She tried to stop you, but you were too much for her... [Geralt goes to see Ves.] VES: Hmm? The madame told me about our drinking binge yesterday... GERALT: I talked to the madame. Is what she says true? VES: I tried to talk you out of it, but you insisted you'd cross the river on the whores' arses. You tried for several hours, but it just wasn't going to be. GERALT: What happened next? VES: You said you wanted to be one of the Blue Stripes and had to get yourself a tattoo. GERALT: What tattoo? VES: One like ours. And you got it. GERALT: Shit... Where're my things? VES: You left them all over the place. I gathered them in that trunk by the window. GERALT: Thanks, Ves. [Geralt goes to see Triss in the tavern.] TRISS: I'm glad you're here. You know how to remove a tattoo? GERALT: Listen... You know how to remove a tattoo? TRISS: I thought you looked different. Couldn't put my finger on it, though. GERALT: Hm. Think it looks all right? TRISS: What's it of? A naked lady brandishing a sword? Geralt... GERALT: All right. You can stop now. TRISS: Hey, I didn't give you that tattoo. TRISS: There's this mixture that cleanses the tissue just beneath your skin... To make it, I'll need green mould, white myrtle petals and wolf's aloe. Ha-ha.... [Ingredients not ready] GERALT: Well, I'm off to hunt down some herbs... I'd appreciate it if you didn't mention this to Dandelion...and you can stop laughing. TRISS: Ah-huh... No, I can't... [Ingredients ready] GERALT: I've got the ingredients. TRISS: Sure you don't want to keep it? Yeah, I'm sure. GERALT: Just get rid of it. Now that you mention it... GERALT: You know what? I think I will. I mean, not everybody's got a special forces tattoo... TRISS: That's for sure. Just like not everyone's got all their teeth... GERALT: Have something against tattoos? TRISS: I love 'em, especially the kind you get in prison. Those really add character... GERALT: Very funny. ",

    "content": "&lt; PREV CONTENTS NEXT &gt; [This quest can be initiated by either Geralt finding the hospital on his own, or by talking to Cedric.] . GERALT: Greetings. CEDRIC: Greetings. GERALT: Nice day. CEDRIC: The day is awful, like every day in the Pontar Valley. I appreciate your courtesy, witcher, but get to the point if you want something. I'm looking for some witchers' work. GERALT: I need to make a few orens. You wouldn't happen to have a job for a witcher, would you? CEDRIC: There's never a shortage of work for a witcher in this forest. It's positively teeming with beasts. Though I'm not surprised they come here in droves... GERALT: Know why that is? CEDRIC: Cursed places attract all sorts of scum, like dung attracts flies. There was once a great house in the clearing. They locked up lunatics there... During the war with Nilfgaard, it was razed in a fire. The lunatics broiled in their cells. The ruins remain cursed to this day. Two daredevils went off to explore the ruins recently... They haven't been seen since... GERALT: A great house, you say. Tell me more about the building itself. CEDRIC: It was an old manor house that was converted into a mental institution. There was no shortage of lunatics in wartime - they just kept coming. Reverend Mircei locked them up in there and looked after them. If you find the two people lost in the ruins of the mental asylum, you stand to be handsomely rewarded. By them... or their families. I'll give it a shot. GERALT: No harm in trying. I don't think I'm interested. GERALT: Doesn't really sound like a job for me. Thanks. [Geralt heads south into the forest to find the old asylum. Just before the ruined walls, he runs into a man.] RUPERT: Some help, finally! I thought I was done for. GERALT: What's wrong? RUPERT: I'm fine, but my friend remains in that damned hospital! [If Geralt talked to Cedric] GERALT: Cedric told me that two people went missing near the burnt mansion. RUPERT: I'm Rupert Brandhuber. I'm a medic from Aedirn. I came here with a friend to look for a very rare species of herbs. GERALT: These woods aren't the best place for herb picking. RUPERT: So we were warned. But the temptation was too great. We got as far as the site of the fire... no sign of herbs, but... there was something downstairs... something... RUPERT: What's that? Can you hear it? That's Gridley's dog. Feel that? Something approaches... Help us! [Nekkers erupt from the ground. Geralt fights them off] RUPERT: Find my companion, I beg you... [Deeper in the ruins, Geralt finds the body of Gridley's dog, and goes down the stairs into the asylum. In the first room he sees a specter surrounded by fire, wearing a winged helmet.] GHOST: They should not have done it! Madder than those here, they were... Oh, the greed... [Geralt makes his way further into the hospital, fighting wraiths as he goes. He discovers some of the hospital's records, detailing the 'treatment' they gave the patients. Soon he encounters the ghost again.] GHOST: They needn't have done it... Those here were innocents... And I? [Geralt continues through the hospital, following the spectre. Other ghosts surround him, some of them malevolent, some of them simply re-enacting their past in the asylum.] GERALT: Whatever happened here made quite an impression, even on those who were mad. [He encounters Rupert's partner Gridley huddled in a ball on the floor.] GRIDLEY: Le–le–leave me be! Away with you! GERALT: Control yourself. GRIDLEY: It's not my fault... it wasn't me, not me...! GERALT: What's not your fault? GRIDLEY: Fire... Fire everywhere... It wasn't meant to happen! I didn't want that... I swear! GERALT: Won't get much out of you until I calm you down. Maybe the fire didn't consume everything. Maybe I can find some medicine, a sedative. [In another room, Geralt finds the medicine he was looking for, as well as a document detailing a patient who claimed to have been abducted by the Wild Hunt. He returns to Gridley and sedates him.] . GRIDLEY: What's going on? Where am I? GERALT: Easy. Rupert asked me to find you. GRIDLEY: Rupert... lives? GERALT: Listen, you and your friend – I don't get it yet, but you aren't telling the truth, that's painfully apparent. This place seems to have a very dark past, one you had a hand in. Do you understand me? GRIDLEY: Y–yes. GERALT: Great. So now you can tell me the story, and don't skip a thing. GRIDLEY: S–story? GERALT: There's always a story, Gridley. Spit it out. GRIDLEY: *Sigh* We're former soldiers, fought for Aedirn during one of the wars with Nilfgaard – times long past. I was Rupert's adjutant in the field hospital that our unit set up in this manor house. We didn't at all mind who lived here. In fact, the inmates were friendly... At the outset, that is. GRIDLEY: One day our scouts captured a Nilfgaardian. He was desperate to win his freedom and claimed he was part of a detachment that had concealed the booty looted in Aedirn. We couldn't believe our fortune, thought the gods had smiled upon us. We'd heard incredible tales of this treasure, questioned any Black One we'd captured. It seemed all our efforts would finally be rewarded. We decided to make him talk. GERALT: By torturing him? GRIDLEY: Our commander wanted to break him on the wheel, but Rupert said he knew a better way. There's a local herb - if you brew and drink it, you can only tell the truth. GRIDLEY: The commander interrogated the prisoner, drawing a map in the process. And we celebrated, talked of how we would divide the treasure, and took ever greater liberties with the patients. The priest looking after them began to protest, and one of our boys... split his head open. GERALT: Nice, Gridley. Keep talking and I just might let you go alive and intact. What happened next? GRIDLEY: Once the prisoner revealed where the treasure was hidden, the commander had him quartered in front of the lunatics... They'd shown signs of madness before, but when they smelled blood, well, we could not control them. Many we simply had to cut down... I don't even know how the fire broke out. GERALT: Any of the patients survive? GRIDLEY: A young woman we managed to pull from the burning building. She was nice, quiet and... willing. Two nights later she slit our commander's throat and that was all we saw of her, and of the map, of course. The war was ongoing and shifting fronts forced us to abandon our search for her soon after. GERALT: And here you are, back after many years. Really think you can still find her around here? GRIDLEY: Life's not treated me well since then, and Rupert's had it even worse. This is our chance to reverse our fortunes. Fate smiled upon us once, perhaps by some strange chance it still holds us in favor? GERALT: *Sigh* I wouldn't count on that. I think we're dealing with one heavy curse here, and it looks like we need to start by finding that Nilfgaardian's corpse. [Gridley flees, and Geralt goes after the Nilfgaardian ghost. He finds it kneeling over its own corpse.] GHOST: A wolf leading wolves... GERALT: What do you want, specter? Their deaths? GHOST: Two of twenty return where none remain. Yet one shall judge them. If he is merciful, he will feed them to the dead. If he is cruel, he will grant them what they came for. GERALT: A prophecy. I should've expected as much. GHOST: Bring me their hearts, so I may feast on their cowardice... Bring me their eyes, so I may spit in them before they are forever extinguished. GERALT: Is that your offer? Fine. I'll lift this curse one way or another. [Geralt goes back to find Gridley.] GRIDLEY: And...? GERALT: I met the Nilfgaardian's ghost. Let's find your comrade. [They return to the surface together.] RUPERT: Gridley! You live... What happened down there? GERALT: I found the ghost of the emperor's soldier. RUPERT: You're the witcher. Get rid of it. You need to see something. Come with me. [Surrender Rupert and Gridley to the ghost.] GERALT: I already have. Come on... Let me show you something. The ghost wants you dead. GERALT: The ghost wants revenge. It brought you here, to the scene of the crime. It'll lift the curse in return for you. RUPERT: By the gods! You'll not help him, will you? GERALT: The ghost wants your hearts and your eyes... RUPERT: Gods! You must trick him! Surely you know a way! GERALT: I could pull the hearts out of some nekkers. Thing is, I'm wondering if it's worth it. RUPERT: Witcher! I beg you! Do what you must, go see the butcher for some pigs' eyes and hearts. Anything! You'll not send us to a cruel death? GERALT: Pig hearts? I suppose there'd be some poetic justice in that. [If Geralt chooses to give them up to the ghost] [Gridley and Rupert follow Geralt down into the asylum, where the ghost is waiting.] GHOST: Who do I see...? Remember me? Corpse-men... Remember how I was torn apart bit by bit? Remember what you did with the people of this house? RUPERT: You deceived us! GERALT: Crimes require punishment and only retribution can lift the curse. I leave them to you. GHOST: I need you no more. Let the feast begin, boys... [Rupert and Gridley are immolated by the vengeful spirit.] [If Geralt chooses to try and trick the ghost] [Geralt can either loot the nekkers from earlier for hearts and eyes or go to the butcher in Flotsam for pigs' organs.] BUTCHER: Hungry? I've fresh meat from some piglets I slaughtered yesterday. There's also some beef, and some venison from the elves. You'll not find better meat for miles. GERALT: I need two pig hearts and two pairs of eyes. BUTCHER: Wh-what do you need those for? GERALT: For the needy and hungry. BUTCHER: Ah, right. Not my concern. Folk say all kinds of things about witchers, but I expect you know that already. GERALT: Yeah, and most of what they say is true. BUTCHER: Aye. Two hearts and two pairs of eyes. I needn't know anything more. [Geralt descends back into the asylum with his eyes and hearts.] GHOST: You return... GERALT: With hearts and eyes. And now you'll swear an oath: once I give you what I've brought, you'll release your hold on this place. GHOST: Not so fast, witcher... GERALT: I want a pact. I want you to swear on this curse. Then keep your word or your lust for revenge will go unsatisfied forever. GHOST: I'll trust you... Let shadows withdraw into darkness. Let madness be soothed. Let what has died be buried. Let this place that was cursed be so no more! GHOST: Now give me what you've brought. GHOST: Fool who knows not that the dead cannot be deceived. You sought to rob me of my revenge, dog! You shall share the fate of those thieves! [The ghost attacks. Geralt defeats it, and returns to Rupert and Gridley.] GERALT: I destroyed the Nilfgaardian soldier's ghost. RUPERT: Thank you, witcher! Now, go away. GERALT: The ruins are safe, now get out of my sight. RUPERT: But... GERALT: Leave before I change my mind. You have to be punished. GERALT: I've lifted the curse, but the perpetrators must be punished. RUPERT: What are you going to do? GERALT: I'll take you to Loredo. Let him pass judgment. RUPERT: No, not him! Just not him! We'll not go anywhere! GERALT: Shut up. [If Geralt chooses to have them punished, he takes them to Loredo's compound.] GUARD: Halt! Who you got there? GERALT: Murderers. Loredo needs to judge them. GUARD: Get out of here. Look at him acting like a constable. [Loredo's mother emerges from the compound suddenly.] MARIETTA: Guests? How nice. Bring 'em to me. We shall talk about the good old days... MARIETTA: Ha, ha, ha! ",

MALENA: I don't know what you're talking about. GUARD: Commandant Loredo will explain everything. MALENA: You've no right! [Geralt interrupts.] GERALT: What's going on here? GUARD 1: This whore's a Scoia'tael spy! GERALT: Any evidence? GUARD 1: What's it to you? GUARD 2: Easy. She loiters around the garrison, coquetting us. Rodrig says he boned her, but I don't believe that. GUARD 3: I did! GERALT: That's your evidence? GUARD 2: Two of our lads are missing. Last seen with her. MALENA: I only spoke to them. Then they went off towards the caves. That's all I know. GUARD 3: The bitch is lying! She led them into an ambush! GERALT: This oughta be easy enough to resolve. Look inside the caves. GUARD 2: But they're crawling with all sorts of filth. Sounds like a local squabble to me. GERALT: Do what you will. This is none of my business. GUARD 2: We'll take her to Loredo. He'll get the truth out of her. Leave it to me. GERALT: I'll do it. But you'll pay me. Wait for me at the harbor. [The guards walk off with Malena towards the harbor. Geralt meets them there at the entrance to a cave.] GUARD 1: We'll wait out here. GUARD 2: Make it quick. [At the entrance to the cave is a blood smear.] GERALT: A lot of blood... And I'm about to find out who it belonged to. [Inside the cave are dozens of nekkers, more blood smears, and a body near the entrance.] GERALT: Someone dragged this body here... [At the end of the cave are two guards with arrows sticking out of them.] GERALT: Scoia'tael arrows... This is pretty clear... [Geralt returns to Malena and Loredo's men.] GUARD 1: Find anything in there? GERALT: Two soldiers. GUARD 1: What happened to 'em? Monsters killed them. GERALT: They're dead. Half-eaten, too. GUARD 1: You sure? GERALT: Their bodies are shredded like mincemeat... GUARD 2: Uh, any idea what happened...? GERALT: Seems something lured your patrol to the cave. Unfortunately, the soldiers weren't prepared for what they found and paid for that. Just like you can pay me now. GUARD 2: Sure, sure... You've earned it. They were shot. GERALT: They're dead. Riddled with arrows. MALENA: I know nothing about that. GUARD 1: What do you think, witcher? GERALT: Seems like two soldiers wandered into the cave - maybe to drive away monsters, but just because somebody convinced them to go. I don't know how many monsters they managed to kill, but I do know who got them. Scoia'tael. MALENA: Bollocks! GERALT: Last I recall, nekkers don't know how to use bows. GUARD 1: Hey, lads...! Let's find a tree! MALENA: No! I'll tell you everything - just don't kill me, please! Let's hear it. GERALT: Speak. MALENA: You need to see this. You won't understand otherwise. GUARD 2: See ploughing what? GUARD 1: The bitch is lying. I don't believe you. GERALT: Give it up, elf. GUARD 1: Let's take her to the Commandant. MALENA: Loredo will torture me. I hope my screams wake you every night, vatt'ghern! GUARD 1: Shut it! Thanks, witcher - you've earned your reward. Lead on. GERALT: We'll see. You lead. Enough of your lies. [Same as \"I don't believe you.\"] [If Geralt says they were killed by Scoia'tael and allows Malena to lead them] [Malena leads them to the place were Geralt, Triss, and Roche were ambused by Iorveth when they entered Flotsam, and a Scoia'tael band attacks.] . GUARD: It's an ambush! To arms! MALENA: Death awaits you all! Curse you, dh'oine! [If any of Loredo's men die] GUARD: They all died - because of you. GERALT: Me...? GUARD: You believed that bitch, which makes you dumber than Dmitri, I think. Now, take your coin for killing the monsters and beat it. We're taking you to Loredo, hag! [If all of Loredo's men survive] GUARD 1: Bloody Squirrels. Thanks for the help, witcher. Here's your orens. You're coming with us, bitch! GUARD 2: You shouldn't've left Dmitri, stupid whore. MALENA: Death awaits you all! Curse you, dh'oine! . [If Geralt tells the guards they were killed by monsters [The guards leave, and Malena thanks him afterwards.] . MALENA: You saved me, witcher. Humans don't usually side with elves. GERALT: I'm not your ordinary human. MALENA: That's true. Any chance I could learn just how unusual you are...? GERALT: What do you have in mind? MALENA: You'll see. You'll find me in the forest, by the waterfall. Just remember, I won't wait forever. GERALT: The forest is dangerous, you can't go alone. MALENA: We elves have our paths. Don't worry about me. [Geralt goes to meet Malena by the waterfall.] . MALENA: I'm glad you came. GERALT: Me, too. MALENA: But you see... There is one problem. GERALT: Let me hear it. MALENA: I really did lure those two guards into a trap. GERALT: I know. I found the arrows. MALENA: Exactly - you know too much. And only corpses keep their secrets... [A Scoia'tael party ambushes Geralt.] . [If Geralt threw Iorveth his sword during the Letho confrontation] ELF WOMAN: Look what the werecat dragged in. MALENA: He knows too much! You must kill him! ELF WOMAN: Oh, Malena, Malena. I'm afraid you're unaware of recent occurrences. And there's nothing worse than a misinformed and reckless spy. I'm no longer surprised that Dmitri abandoned you. MALENA: He knows! ELF WOMAN: Much has changed, darling. The witcher's an ally now, and it's poor manners to threaten allies. You must lift the insult, so plough him - that's about all you do well. MALENA: You whore! I'll... ELF MAN: That's enough! Leave, witcher. Ask no questions. I believe all is apparent anyway. GERALT: What about Malena? ELF MAN: She will come with us. GERALT: What'll you do with her? ELF MAN: No questions. It's not your concern. And I apologize for this misunderstanding. [If Geralt hasn't sided with Iorveth, he fights off the Scoia'tael as Malena runs off into the forest. After Geralt defeats his attackers, he goes to look for her. He finds her hiding in the ruins of the old asylum.] . MALENA: Mercy... You don't deserve any... GERALT: You deserve to die. [Geralt kills Malena.] . Loredo will judge you. GERALT: I'm taking you to Loredo. You'll be judged there. [Geralt takes Malena to the guards.] GUARD: What are you doing here with that elven slut? GERALT: You were right.

ANEZKA: Maybe it's warning you not to make a pass at me lest I slap you? GERALT: You're right, I should watch what I do. ANEZKA: Listen carefully. People may say I'm a witch, but I don't deal in spells. You don't look like someone who'd come for a charm or a curse, so you either seek out sensations or hunt witches. Whichever the case... GERALT: I'm not about to denounce you, nor do I want to see you dancing naked in the moonlight before Veyopatis's shrine. ANEZKA: How dare you? GERALT: I want to buy some herbs. ANEZKA: Herbs? GERALT: For personal use. Tell me what you know about this amulet. GERALT: What do you know about protective amulets? ANEZKA: I'm no sorceress, but I know a bit about magic. Why do you ask? GERALT: Take a look at this one. I have reason to believe there's something not quite right about it... ANEZKA: Hmmm.... I'd say there's magic in it without a doubt. I'd gladly buy it from you. I wouldn't mind selling it. GERALT: Pay me enough and... ANEZKA: I can give you 50 orens. GERALT: That's nowhere near enough. ANEZKA: All right... Let's say a hundred. GERALT: Why do you want the talisman? ANEZKA: Why do you? GERALT: Let's say it's got sentimental value for me. ANEZKA: Let's say I see it as a collector's item. I'll give you two hundred orens and that's my final offer. I want to get rid of it. GERALT: If you have the coin, the talisman's yours. ANEZKA: 200 orens - there you are. What's your final offer? GERALT: What's it worth to you? ANEZKA: 200 orens. I've changed my mind. GERALT: I'm not selling the talisman. It must be precious to you. GERALT: Why do you care about the amulet so much? ANEZKA: I collect antiques. They may be useless to others, but I see value in them. GERALT: I don't believe you. You want to buy a piece of metal just because it's old? ANEZKA: I don't have to explain myself to you. I need to ask you something else. GERALT: I get the feeling you know a lot more about this trinket than you're letting on. ANEZKA: Maybe I do, maybe I don't. If I say only so much, I must have my reasons. [PERSUASION] A customer like me doesn't come along often... GERALT: I'm a witcher. You don't want to lose a customer like me. [FAILURE] ANEZKA: Is that so...? Typical witcher... You're here, there and everywhere... I won't get much trade out of you. GERALT: If you say so. [SUCCESS] ANEZKA: Huh. I suppose you've convinced me. GERALT: Let's get down to it then. ANEZKA: This isn't any old talisman. I'm almost certain it's Melitele's Heart. It's a very powerful artifact. At least, it used to be. GERALT: It isn't any more? ANEZKA: It was cursed and the spell distorted its effect. It once protected those who wore it, now it brings misery upon them. GERALT: Why do you want to buy it from me, then? ANEZKA: I know a ritual that can restore its original power. Unfortunately, the necessary ingredients are extremely rare. GERALT: What do you need? ANEZKA: Essence of death, a troll's tongue, the eyes of an arachas and an endrega's fetus. GERALT: I might be able to get you those. I'm interested in that ritual. GERALT: I want to know everything there is to know about this ritual. ANEZKA: Ask away. What is Melitele's Heart? GERALT: Tell me more about Melitele's Heart. ANEZKA: They say the talisman was made at the time of the Conjunction of Spheres. It gave those who wore it supernatural powers. Some didn't like that. The talisman was cursed by a dark force and lost its former power. Can you perform the ritual? GERALT: Can you conduct the ritual? [If Geralt doesn't have the ingredients] ANEZKA: You must find all the ingredients first. GERALT: All right, I get it. [If Geralt has the ingredients] ANEZKA: I see you have all the ingredients. If you make up your mind, come to the statue of Veyopatis at midnight. GERALT: All right. I'll be there. [Geralt meets Anezka by the statue of Veyopatis after sundown.] ANEZKA: Here at last. GERALT: I don't know many brave enough to venture into this forest, especially at night. ANEZKA: I do not fear the Squirrels and I have my methods for the monsters. GERALT: Interesting. ANEZKA: This place is full of mysteries that even witchers can't imagine. GERALT: You're the main mystery right now. Why do you need me? I don't know the ritual. ANEZKA: You'll find out once I begin performing it. ANEZKA: Are you ready? So long. GERALT: I changed my mind. I am. GERALT: Let's begin. ANEZKA: Prepare, witcher. And now, watch this. [Anezka begins the ritual, and wraiths begin appearing.] ANEZKA: You must fight them. I need time to finish the ritual! ANEZKA: I've done it! [If the ritual failed] GERALT: Did you succeed? ANEZKA: I'm afraid not... Melitele's Heart will bring ill luck to those who come to possess it. [If the ritual succeeded] GERALT: Did you manage? ANEZKA: Melitele's Heart has regained its former power. I can feel it... GERALT: I never thought you could conduct rituals of that sort. ANEZKA: Did you take me for a village witch who puts bread and cobwebs on wounds? GERALT: What you did is closer to sorcery. ANEZKA: Sorceresses, with all their learned books and schools of magic! What do they know? ANEZKA: Magic, witcher, is the heart beating fast or the smell of wet, rotting wood. It upsets the underbelly and makes you weep and cry... It's the scythe that misses a field mouse nest, it's people coupling under the new moon till it hurts, it's blood spilled and sweet milk flowing. That is magic. I've experienced all that and seen everything. I can control it. I wouldn't trade places with any sorceress. GERALT: I don't know if I understand you, but I sure admire you. ANEZKA: Take this talisman as a memento of our meeting. GERALT: But you really wanted it. ANEZKA: You helped me lift the curse from it and asked nothing in return. Generosity is a rare virtue. Melitele's Heart can once again bring luck - I think you will get more out of it than I will. GERALT: Thank you. ANEZKA: Come to me if you need anything. Better the devil you know... ",

The Captain's log details an expedition funded by King Foltest for valuable artifacts, which the ship's mage attempted to steal by starting a mutiny.] [CAPTAIN'S LOG: &nbsp; [...]The expedition to Loc Muinne has proven a success that will doubtlessly please both King Foltest, who so generously backed our expedition, as well as the university. Oswen seems exceptionally pleased. I have never before seen a sorcerer jumping for joy. [...] &nbsp; [...] Oswen tried to get the crew to mutiny, offering them the valuables we had discovered, in order to keep the artifacts for himself. Fortunately Foltest's marines remained loyal. Passing Vergen, there was a battle in which we sunk the Daerdin. We had to flee though, continually attacked by the harpies summoned by Oswen's spell.[...] &nbsp; [...] Oswen's spell still has the power to attract monsters, even though the sorcerer now lies at the bottom of the river. The soldiers bravely repel the monstrosities that harass us. I'm almost finished with my report for Oxenfurt, which sums up the results of our research and marks the location of the Daerdin's resting place. We're almost home.

The letter can be mailed in Loredo's house, or in Ludwig Merse's office, where there is associated dialogue.] MERSE: Greetings, witcher. What brings you here? Hm, is that a postbox...? GERALT: On your desk - is that a drop box for the Royal Post? MERSE: Yes, I am the local Royal Postmaster - one of my many responsibilities. [AXII] Can I take a look? GERALT: Would you mind if I looked inside? [FAILURE] MERSE: No, not under any circumstances! All correspondence is confidential. Only those bearing a special letter may even open the box. [SUCCESS] MERSE: Absolutely no problem. Enjoy your reading. Who are you? GERALT: What do you do? MERSE: I'm the royal castellan. I look after Flotsam's provisions, fortifications and so forth. GERALT: So if I exterminate a monster, I need to see you about the reward? MERSE: Indeed. You could start by filling in form H-12 and taking it to... GERALT: I don't need to. I've got immunity. MERSE: Ah. Well, you'll find the notice board out in front of the inn. And good hunting to you. GERALT: So long. [Inside the post box Geralt finds an entirely fabricated report to the Temerian Special Forces suggesting that there is no crime in Flotsam.] ",

MATILDA: You've got to do something about that filthy business. The crook selling the poison is going unpunished! GERALT: I think he's just selling incense. MATILDA: Incense is only a cover. People get addicted to it, lose their senses... it's like fisstech. MATILDA: You must shut down that shop. Close the shop, and the citizens of Flotsam will reward you handsomely. GERALT: I'll talk to the trader. MATILDA: You haven't closed the shop. People continue to get addicted to that rubbish because of you. GERALT: No one's forcing them to buy incense. MATILDA: You'd not say that if your own were sniffing it. Get out of here! [Geralt goes to check on the shopkeeper - the same shopkeeper Pugg wanted him to investigate.] VINCENT BARTOK: Welcome to my modest shop. I need a certain formula. GERALT: I need one of your incense formulae. BARTOK: I've got more than 200 here. GERALT: I'm interested in the bestseller. GERALT: Someone's offering a handsome price for that formula. They say it's harmful. BARTOK: Impossible! I haven't had a single complaint. And I'll not give the formula to anyone. How about this...? I give you a formula for a similar scent. You get your reward and I keep my secret. Agreed. GERALT: Agreed. BARTOK: Wait a second... There you go. [INTIMIDATION] If I don't get that formula immediately... GERALT: If I don't get the real formula by the count of five, you'll be greeting one of the two friends I carry on my back. One.. Two... [FAILURE] BARTOK: You won't intimidate me. Get out of my sight! [SUCCESS] BARTOK: Wa-wait a minute. Maybe we can come to an agreement. GERALT: Three... BARTOK: All right! Wait! I'll give it to you! Here. Happy? [SHOPPING] What do you deal in? GERALT: What do you deal in? BARTOK: All kinds of incense, mainly. For meditation... rejuvenation... cooking, making medicine, rituals... Whatever you require. Are you selling drugs? GERALT: They say one of your scents is a strong drug. BARTOK: A drug? Here? Never heard such nonsense! GERALT: A lady told me it works just like fisstech. BARTOK: Perhaps everything works like fisstech on that lady. I see. GERALT: I get it. [AXII] I know there's something exceptional about it... GERALT: I know there's something unusual about it. [FAILURE] BARTOK: Sure - the ingredients. They cost me a fortune! [SUCCESS] BARTOK: All right, I admit it. I've traded in incense for years. It was an ordinary scent - how could I know it would have such an effect on people? Anyway... I can't ban them from using it. [INTIMIDATION] I have a feeling Loredo would be interested in this incense... GERALT: Maybe Loredo needs to learn about your incense. [FAILURE] BARTOK: Loredo doesn't frighten me. [SUCCESS] BARTOK: I beg you... I'll tell you everything, just don't turn me in. [Continues the same as AXII success] How come that incense is so popular? GERALT: Why is this incense so popular all of a sudden? Don't tell me it’s the scent. BARTOK: But it is! It took me a long time to devise it, and the ingredients cost me a fortune. That's why it's so good. I believe you. GERALT: You sound honest enough. [PERSUASION] Why would you want to poison your neighbors? GERALT: You've lived with these people since childhood. Why would you want to poison them? [FAILURE] BARTOK: Are you joking? How am I to make a living? [SUCCESS] BARTOK: You're right, witcher. [INTIMIDATION] I'll be back here tomorrow - with Loredo. GERALT: Loredo and I will see you tomorrow. BARTOK: All right, then! I'll close the shop. But don't tell anyone, I beg you. GERALT: Before you close up, why don't you give me the formula for that incense. [Geralt goes to tell Matilda the shop is closed.] MATILDA: I see you've done it! Thank you, on behalf of all Flotsam. Here's your reward. [Geralt returns to Vencel Pugg.] PUGG: How did it go? Did you get the formula? Not yet. GERALT: I'm working on it... I'm not about to give it to you. GERALT: I did. But I'm not gonna give it to you. PUGG: We'll meet again, smartarse. [Pugg and his men later ambush Geralt in the forest.] Yup. GERALT: I have it. PUGG: Show me. GERALT: Here it is. PUGG: Grand. I must check its authenticity in the lab before I can give you your coin. I'm a cautious man, forgive me. GERALT: I'm cautious, too. Give me back the formula. PUGG: All right, we'll go together. I'll wait for you by the gate, at the market side. [Geralt meets Pugg outside Flotsam's gates.] PUGG: Ready? As I said, I'm cautious. My lab is well-hidden and I want to keep it that way, so I'll... have to blindfold you. All right. GERALT: All right, but no tricks. One false move and you'll never open your secret door again. PUGG: I'm not mad enough to mess with you. Grab hold of my arm. No deal. GERALT: You never mentioned a blindfold. I like to know where I'm going. PUGG: Forgive me, but secrecy is essential to me. If you can't agree, it's all off. So be it. [Same as \"All right.\"] Fine. Deal's off. GERALT: I'm cautious, too. Only time I ever agree to be blindfolded is when I'm with a naked sorceress. Farewell. PUGG: Wait... You’re a tough nut, but have it your way. I'll mark the lab on your map and expect to see you there. [If Geralt agreed to be blindfolded] PUGG: My workshop is very near... PUGG: Almost there... PUGG: Now, Porky! [Geralt wakes up in a cell inside a cave.] PUGG: Sincere apologies, again. I know you could slice me up like a juicy side of beef if you wanted to. I had to protect myself. [If Geralt did not agree to be blindfolded] [Geralt makes his way to Pugg's workshop.] PUGG: Welcome to my humble abode. PUGG: I'll ask you to be patient while my men check the formula. You've no idea how hard it is to find qualified specialists these days. In Bleinheim's day I worked with only the best alchemists. GERALT: Bleinheim? I'm under the impression I know the name. Somebody from Flotsam? PUGG: No, Vizima. Long ago. I need a moment – the results are ready. [If Geralt agreed to the blindfold and gave a fake formula] PUGG: A fake after all. You should not have tried to deceive me. GERALT: I actually felt a bit guilty, but then you flapped your tongue one too many times, revealed your allegiance to Salamandra. PUGG: In that case, you'll need to stay here. [Geralt breaks through the cell wall with Aard and fights the Salamandra thugs.] [If Geralt refused a blindfold and gave a fake formula] PUGG: Not good, witcher. Trying to cheat me? I'm afraid that carries a severe penalty. GERALT: Salamandra stragglers in Flotsam. Who would've thunk. Leave your weapons and come with me. PUGG: Who are you trying to fool? Tend to this scum, boys! [Geralt fights the Salamandra thugs.] [If Geralt gave him the real formula] PUGG: Grand, legal fisstech! Oh, this will be a big fat vein of gold... GERALT: The truth will out. Besides, I have a low tolerance for lying. PUGG: Don't you threaten me. Take your earnings, fair and as agreed - and no tricks! Forgive me, I was not sure if I could trust you. Here's your reward - you fully deserve it. PUGG: My men will see you off. Please let them cover your eyes again. I hope to do more business with you sometime. Agreed. GERALT: One false move and you'll be looking for new workers. Not likely. GERALT: I'd probably agree, if I didn't remember that Bleinheim was one of Salamandra's commanders. PUGG: In that case, you'll need to stay here. [Geralt fights the Salamandra thugs.] [If Geralt kills the thugs, a hidden sailboat allows him to return to Flotsam.] ",

    "content": "&lt; PREV CONTENTS [Geralt picks up the note on the notice board about a problem troll and heads out to find its lair. On the way, he encounters a man being attacked by nekkers, and intervenes to save him.] MAN: Thank you, master... MAN: Drives me mad. This cursed wood is full of scum and that whoreson has lost his mind! GERALT: Who might that be? MAN: The troll. For years he's been collecting tolls at the bridge, for which he's to keep the bridge tidy and drive away the scum. GERALT: What's the problem, then? MAN: Merchants from the port sent me to find out the what and why, seeing as this is the only path out of the port inland. But I found the bridge in ruins and that cheeky cocksucker asked for liquor to let me pass. \"Across that pile of rubble?\" I says, and he smacks me so hard I see stars! [If Geralt picked up the notice on the board] GERALT: Loredo's put a price on his head. MAN: If Loredo had his way, he'd cut us off from the world, that son of a bitch. MAN: We need a bridge, but a working one! And we need a troll, but a sober one! MAN: If you're looking to make some coin, hold off on killing the troll and see the village chief instead. He'll tell you all you need to know. [Geralt goes to see the village chief in Lobinden.] GERALT: Any work for a witcher? CHORAB: Enough work for three, but what of it? We're poor folk. GERALT: I'm sure we can work something out. CHORAB: Ye best go to Flotsam town square, near the inn. There are notices on the board there. Just leave the troll be, please, no matter what the townsfolk say. The troll. GERALT: You got a troll here? CHORAB: Aye, he trolls in the forest, by the river. But he's a good fellow, don't you dare harm him. GERALT: One of the helpful ones. I see. CHORAB: Does more good than Loredo, and drinks a lot less at that. Repairs the bridge and causes no mischief. Don't take your blades to him, please. Got any other work for me? [If the kayran is alive] CHORAB: Go seek the Old Man. Loredo splurged on a sorceress, so he's clearly got means in the budget. What sorceress? GERALT: What sorceress? You mean Triss Merigold? CHORAB: Lady Síle de Tansarville, a significant person, but poor as a temple mouse, just like ye. Seems spellcraft and wealth don't go hand in hand. They say she's agreed to kill the Old Man, so hurry if ye want to jump in before her. The Old Man? GERALT: You mean the kayran? CHORAB: Call him whatever ye like. I mean the river beast. He troubled our great-grandfathers already. But he's become unbearable recently, tearing through nets, choking fish with venom. CHORAB: Even Loredo says that since the local economy be harmed, there be no choice but to hire a sorceress. [If the kayran is dead] CHORAB: Ye killed the kayran. Not enough for you? Truth be told, ye won't find better work around here. You defend the troll. What's in it for you? GERALT: I heard you don't want to get rid of the troll. CHORAB: Who'll maintain the bridge when he's gone? GERALT: Hire some people. CHORAB: Know the cost of a craftsman these days? That idiot troll looks after the bridge for petty tolls, more or less. GERALT: The bridge is in ruins and the troll's robbing people. CHORAB: Aye... It's because he's hit the bottle. GERALT: If you could help him stop boozing... GERALT: I'm a witcher, not a nanny. CHORAB: I'll pay you well. GERALT: How much? CHORAB: A hundred orens. GERALT: Two hundred. CHORAB: You're costly, but what the hell. Let 'em see I place the village's welfare above all else. [Geralt checks in with Ludwig Merse about the contract.] . GERALT: Any idea why Loredo put a price on the troll's head? MERSE: Commandant Loredo has Flotsam's welfare in mind. GERALT: Mhm, but the troll tends to the bridge, keeps it in repair. MERSE: Not likely. To start with, that's a dangerous beast. In addition, he pays no taxes on the tolls he collects. [Geralt goes back to the troll's lair to see what's up.] TROLL: No. GERALT: No what? TROLL: No passage. Give vodka, you passage. I don't have any vodka. GERALT: Do I look like an innkeeper to you? TROLL: No vodka, no passage. I won't pay to cross a ruined bridge. GERALT: Why should I pay you? TROLL: My bridge. GERALT: This is a pile of rubble, not a bridge. You're getting nothing from me. TROLL: Ah, from me, you get in mug. [The troll attacks Geralt. Geralt retaliates.] TROLL: Enough. Don't hit. I be good. What's with the heavy drinking? GERALT: You're drunk. TROLL: Vodka good. Head hurt, aye. But no pain in brain. GERALT: Brain pain always comes with a reason. TROLL: They kill my woman. She good. She cooked meat. GERALT: Who killed her? TROLL: Dunno. Me sit on bridge. Go home. No meat smell. Woman dead. Had no head. Gotsta drink. Inn can't go - people'd kill. But gotsta drink. At least fix the bridge. GERALT: You're welcome to take liquor instead of coin, but you should repair the bridge. TROLL: Cannot. Hands shaky. [Continues same as \"I'll find the murderers\"] I'll find the murderers, and you'll stop drinking... GERALT: If I find your woman's murderers, will you put aside the booze? TROLL: You no find none. GERALT: We'll see. I've got friends here. I'll talk to them. Not good enough. GERALT: You'll be even better when I'm through with you. [Geralt slays the troll.] [If Geralt kills the troll, he can collect a reward from Merse.] GERALT: I killed the troll. MERSE: The Commandant will be delighted. Your reward... GERALT: Not exactly a fortune. MERSE: You chose a poorly paid profession, witcher. [If Geralt spares the troll, he can ask around for information, starting with Síle.] Would a troll's head have any applications in alchemy? GERALT: Alchemists use troll tissue in their research, don't they? SÍLE: Troll eyes and tendons are potent ingredients, useful in many potions. White Raffard experimented with their blood, claiming it had regenerative properties. He was wrong, of course. GERALT: Is there any reason an alchemist would want a troll's whole head? SÍLE: I don't think so. Unless he wanted a trophy. [Geralt goes to talk to Zoltan.] Why would anyone want a troll's head? ZOLTAN: Sit down, Geralt, you old goat! Drinking alone is as bad as shitting in company. GERALT: Another time, maybe. You've been here a while and probably know the local customs. ZOLTAN: I'm no researcher, but go on, ask away. GERALT: Who would need a troll's head? ZOLTAN: Same folks who need a bear's head - to hang on the wall, show how plucky they are. A peasant with a troll's head on his wall can raise many skirts. GERALT: Thanks. ZOLTAN: Where you off to? GERALT: Sightseeing, 'round the houses of Lobinden. [Geralt heads to Sendler the leatherworker's house. On the wall hangs the head of a troll.] GERALT: A female troll's head... GERALT: Where'd you get that head? SENDLER: I bought it. Cost me a fortune, but it was worth it. No one else in Lobinden's got a troll's head. GERALT: Who'd you buy it from? SENDLER: Dmitri. Who else would dare trap a troll in its very own den? GERALT: Where can I find this Dmitri? SENDLER: That I don't know, but you'll find his mates carousing at the inn in the evening. Thanks. GERALT: Thanks. That was helpful. Let me take that head off your hands. GERALT: I'd like to buy that head from you. SENDLER: No way! The head's mine, you smelly swine! GERALT: I'll give you a good price, unless you'd prefer to trade. SENDLER: Hm... We could roll some dice for it... Provided you make it worth my while. [Geralt wins the she-troll's head in a game of dice poker. He goes to look for Dmitri's man at the tavern.] GERALT: Do you work for Dmitri? BANDIT: Who's asking? 'Cause you see, friend, I'm startin' to find this a might confusing. You here at the biddin' of that old rag, the fisstech boys, or Loredo? And be straight with me! GERALT: I heard you hunted down a troll. BANDIT: None of your ploughing business. [INTIMIDATION] Tell me or I'll turn this place into another Blaviken. [FAILURE] GERALT: Tell me where Dmitri is, or I'll turn your snout into a bloody pulp. BANDIT: Try it! [SUCCESS] GERALT: Heard of the Butcher of Blaviken? BANDIT: Who hasn't? They say he can gut a man with a single cut. GERALT: Yeah, I can. And if you don't tell me where I can find Dmitri, I'll splash your guts on the walls. BANDIT: Steady... GERALT: Start talking. BANDIT: Dmitri hangs around the cemetery near that stinking village. GERALT: See? You can be nice. All you need to do is try. [FISTFIGHT] Afraid you're wrong about that. Put 'em up. [Geralt beats the man in a fistfight.] BANDIT: I'll tell you everything... GERALT: I'm all ears. BANDIT: Dmitri's at the cemetery near Lobinden. [Geralt heads to the cemetery. Three bandits are standing around the corpses of an elf and Thaler's agent.] BANDIT: Loredo'll know that's no Squirrel, but an ordinary elf. DIMITRI: He won't know shit. Ears pointy? Check. We'll dress the corpse in green and collect an even hundred. BANDIT: Heard Malena makes more than that. I guess robbing the soldiery's better business than robbing elves. DIMITRI: I'll not hear of that whore again, got it?! Treacherous rag. She'll get what she deserves, won't be long now. BANDIT: Couldn't satisfy her, eh? Can't fault the girl for being ambitious. And the stiff on the ground is who? DIMITRI: Some spy from Vizima, soon to be our Squirrel's grave mate. Loredo told me to get rid of him, and since we've got this vacancy in the boneyard, thought I might do our friend a small favor. BANDIT: He don’t look like no spy. DIMITRI: They never do once they're dead. Ah, almost forgot – might pay to search him good and thorough before we plant him in the dirt. GERALT: You Dmitri? DIMITRI: Why the fuck d'you want to know? GERALT: The troll sends his regards. DIMITRI: Kill him! No witnesses! [Geralt kills the bandits and heads back to the troll.] TROLL: Give vodka, dwarf. GERALT: You drink too much. Your eyesight's shit. TROLL: Why back? I'm not even here. [EXIT] GERALT: You're imagining things, troll. There's no one here. Ek-hem. I've got your mate's head. GERALT: I found your wife's head. TROLL: My woman... TROLL: I not forget. I give reward. TROLL: But drink will till you give me killman's head. I found your mate's murderers. GERALT: I punished your wife's murderers. TROLL: Mine...?! GERALT: You'll find what's left of them at the cemetery. TROLL: I find! GERALT: Will you fix the bridge? TROLL: Trolls true! GERALT: Make sure your hands are steady when you do it. TROLL: No drink more. Head in peace. [Geralt goes to get his reward from Chorab.] GERALT: You owe me 200 orens. CHORAB: You'll get 100. [INTIMIDATION] All right, and then another 100... [FAILURE] CHORAB: Bandit! You won't get a single oren out of me! Piss off before I call the guards! [SUCCESS] CHORAB: Bandit! GERALT: Thief... CHORAB: Here's two hundred orens and shove it up your arse! [PERSUASION] Hm. The troll didn't try to cheat me... GERALT: Listen, I made deals with you and the troll. He kept his word, you're trying not to... [FAILURE] GERALT: You're a swindler. CHORAB: It'd be yours if I had it. But Lobinden's a poor hamlet. GERALT: All right, make it a hundred. [SUCCESS] CHORAB: I haven't the coin. GERALT: Sure you don't want to look a little harder? CHORAB: What if I don't find any? GERALT: Then I'll look myself. CHORAB: This is robbery... Here, I hope you choke on it. Sheesh. Fine. GERALT: If only I'd known... So long. ",

ROCHE: Flotsam should be just beyond the point. We'll take the beach. GERALT: Who's \"we\"? ROCHE: You and me. Reconnaissance... TRISS: I'm coming, too. ROCHE: You should stay behind. We can't be sure of the reception we'll get. TRISS: Precisely why I won't let you go alone. Someone's gotta look after you. ROCHE: That time of the month? ROCHE: Water's cold as hell. Come on, witcher! ROCHE: Your witcher's arse is going to have to get wet. Jump. TRISS: Come on already! [Geralt, Triss, and Roche begin following the riverbank to Flotsam.] TRISS: Any news from your secret informer? ROCHE: The port's blocked. Some merchants have been held up for months. TRISS: What about roads through the forest...? ROCHE: Iorveth rules the forest. ROCHE: Where are we? TRISS: In a forest? ROCHE: Very funny. But who does it belong to? TRISS: Iorveth, maybe? I know more about the Pontar Valley than you think. For instance, I know that Foltest stole this land from Demavend a few years back. I believe you had a hand in that? GERALT: Hear that? ROCHE: I smell an elf. ROCHE: Foltest had just as much right to this land as Demavend. TRISS: Right? Or do you mean might? . ROCHE: True, there were some skirmishes. Altogether a pleasant foray - experienced fighters only. No peasant footmen or frivolous lords. None of that circus... Ah, you wouldn't understand... [The sound of flute music begins. A short distance down the bank, they find an elf on a fallen log playing the flute.] ROCHE: That's... IORVETH: Vernon Roche! Special Forces Commander for the last four years. Servant of the Temerian king. Responsible for the pacification of the Mahakaman foothills. Hunter of elves, murderer of women and children. Twice decorated for valor on the field of battle... ROCHE: Iorveth - a regular son of a whore. IORVETH: I've long awaited our meeting. Laid plans, set traps... And now you appear in my forest of your own volition. ROCHE: You aided the man who slew my king... IORVETH: King or beggar - what's the difference? One dh'oine less. Since when do the Scoia'tael hire human assassins? GERALT: Since when do the Scoia'tael hire professional killers to do their dirty work? A dh'oine, even. You've fallen low... IORVETH: A hired killer, true. But in all certainty, he is no dh'oine. GERALT: Don't make a big deal of the race thing... IORVETH: Yet race is the very reason we fight! We have pointed ears, yours are rounded. We are few, yet long-lived, your kind multiplies like vermin, though thankfully expires quickly... Humans and elves alike, trying to prove one shape is better than the other. Four hundred years of killing over the mold of the auricle. I've heard enough of your philosophy. GERALT: You're just another old elf in a young elf's skin, using clever words to mask an obvious truth. IORVETH: Obvious you say? GERALT: This is not about race or freedom. Or even vengeance. You're here because someone powerful told you to be. Someone who's using you. They may wear a crown, carry a magic wand, or even lead a guild... But be sure of this: it's not about your freedom, your rights, or your ears. Nilfgaard ploughed you once, now someone new does. Am I wrong? IORVETH: Those times are gone... No one will ever use the Scoia'tael again. GERALT: Who are you addressing? Me, yourself... or the archers in those shrubs? We're here for the kingslayer. GERALT: The kingslayer's among you. We've come for him. IORVETH: Then our interests collide... The kingslayer is under my protection and I'll not hand over a guest. [Whispered] Triss, we need to take him alive. GERALT: We need him alive. Know any useful spells? TRISS: Get his attention, I need to focus. GERALT: I'll try. ROCHE: Climb down and we'll finish this. I await. IORVETH: Hah! You're a man without honor, Vernon Roche. An insect I'll not duel, but one that I will crush. GERALT: Seems like you spout the same old elven drivel. IORVETH: What do you mean, witcher? GERALT: I've seen your kind before. Proud Aen Seidhe sneaking around forests. Helpless, yet masking that with acts of increasing cruelty. IORVETH: I helped kill Roche's king. You call that helpless? Or would you call me a terrorist? No one will grant us our freedom, witcher. We must win it for ourselves. [Continues the same as \"I've heard enough of your philosophy.\"] Where's your unit? GERALT: Where's your unit? Dispersed by a raiding party? IORVETH: They're exactly where they should be. I assure you, no humans can surprise the Scoia'tael. [Continues the same as \"Since when do the Scoia'tael hire human assassins?\"] ROCHE: Enough of this piss! Die! IORVETH: Spar'le! [Arrows rain down on the trio.] TRISS: Addan quen spars-paerpe'tlon Vort! [A golden shield surrounds the three of them.] GERALT: That oughta discourage them. GERALT: Triss, are you all right? TRISS: Lovely... [collapses] ROCHE: You should've charmed the archers... They're coming. ROCHE: Geralt! The spell's still working! Stay close! TRISS: What's... what's happening? ROCHE: Triss is spent, so no more butterflies. Let's get the fuck out of here. GERALT: Back to the boat? ROCHE: There's even more of them that way. We must fight our way toward Flotsam. TRISS: Is that you, Roche?! Get your hands off my ass! ROCHE: Who did you think it was? TRISS: I'm not a sack of flour or one of your commandos. I'm a woman! ROCHE: I noticed. TRISS: Ugh. I'm going to be sick... [Roche carries Triss as Geralt fights the oncoming Scoia'tael.] ROCHE: At least I'll die holding a lovely arse! TRISS: Not mine! I'll hold the spell... ROCHE: Come on! Let's go! TRISS: Stop shaking! I need to focus! ROCHE: Are you all right? TRISS: Yes, fine. ROCHE: Grrrrrr... Sons of bitches... TRISS: What's happening? All I see are your boots. ROCHE: Where the hell is that trading post? ROCHE: I'm starting to think we'll make it. Wait, the barrier's waning... Triss?! TRISS: Be quick. ROCHE: Give me a bit more magic, just a little! ROCHE: Geralt, kill them now! [The town of Flotsam becomes visible in the distance.] FLOTSAM GUARD 1: Scoia'tael attacking! FLOTSAM GUARD 2: Alarm! Squirrels! FLOTSAM GUARD 3: There's a mage among them! Ready yourselves! [The trio make it to Flotsam. Geralt turns back to see Iorveth and his commandos in the distance. Letho comes up next to Iorveth.] IORVETH: You know each other? LETHO: Rather well, but he has amnesia. I actually took the witcher by surprise when I killed Foltest. Fear not, elf. I know Geralt, I know his weakness. [At the edge of Flotsam, Geralt and company regroup.] TRISS: Too many spells at once. You can die from that... ROCHE: See that? GERALT: Yeah, the kingslayer and Iorveth. FLOTSAM GUARD: You all in one piece? Who are you? GERALT: I'm a witcher. ROCHE: Emhyr var Emreis, spice merchant. FLOTSAM GUARD: A trader? ROCHE: In spices. FLOTSAM GUARD: Uh-huh... And the woman? TRISS: My good man, we barely escaped death... Be so kind as to tell us where we might get some rest. We'll explain everything later. FLOTSAM GUARD: Very well. Head for the market square. You might be in time for the execution... Some ne'er-do-wells are going to hang - a dwarf and some bard. There's also an inn and a brothel... TRISS: Oh yeah, the brothel sounds especially interesting. Take care, now. ",

CITIZEN: I do believe you know not whom you address, soldier. GUARD 2: Commandant's orders. We're not to let anyone out, and we won't. GUARD 1: Besides, Cedric claims the forest's dangerous, monsters in the area... CITIZEN: Ah, plough what that drunken elf claims! GUARD 1: And I say plough your whim to take a stroll, you rich minge. Piss off 'fore I slap you across the head with me halberd! GUARD 1: Are you deaf? Gates closed until further notice! CITIZEN: I've had enough! The Commandant'll hear of this! GUARD 2: Ah, go to hell! GERALT: When will you open the gates, soldier? GUARD 1: After the execution. Cedric'll peer out, confirm that it's calm, then we'll open them. Don't ask me how he knows, but he's yet to be wrong, that elf of ours... GERALT: What's this execution about? GUARD 1: Go to the square, see for yourself. [Geralt, Roche, and Triss go to the town square to watch the execution. They realize that two of the people in nooses are Zoltan and Dandelion.] GERALT: Zoltan... Dandelion... ROCHE: My informer. TRISS: Just great. ROCHE: What's the plan? GERALT: We improvise. ROCHE: No killing. GERALT: We'll take care of this, Triss. DANDELION: Geralt! Geralt! Over here! Help! [Geralt approaches the guard in front of the podium.] . GUARD: Step back, white one. What's going on here? GERALT: What are they going to hang for? They don't look dangerous. GUARD: The charge is: Collusion with the Scoia'tael. GERALT: Dandelion - an elven spy? GUARD: The bard's hanging for debauchery. GERALT: What?! GUARD: The sentence was, he's to hang for debauchery. BYSTANDER: And a sentence is nothing to scoff at! People, is this justice as you see it? GERALT: Are you serious? Listen here, people. Is profligacy now a punishable offence in the free Kingdom of Temeria? Or are we in Nilfgaard? GUARD: Ah piss off, freak, or you'll have me to deal with. Think of the common folk - you're spoiling their fun. BYSTANDER: A freak he may be, but he speaks true. Debauchery's one of my favorite pastimes, but I don't want a noose placed 'round my neck for pursuin' it! MARGOT: The soldier boy has paid us a visit or two, though he didn't have much fun. GUARD: Away with you, Margot. Go back to your brothel. MARGOT: I'm to go? Fine. But hear this, people - he sure liked to parade about, but his willie wouldn't come to attention! Hah! GERALT: Stop the execution. GUARD: Shut your trap! The singer's to hang and he will hang - this is a decent town... Whores and witchers notwithstanding! BYSTANDER: Watch your words, guardsman. I don't know witchers, but Margot's a decent woman! GUARD: Shut it! All of you! Or I'll not vouch for what I'll do! MARGOT: Thinks he's tough, showing off his balls, but don't fret, people, I've seen the rot on them! *Cackles* GUARD: I'm warnin' you for the last time, Margot! GERALT: You wouldn't hit a lady... GUARD: You're no lady... I've heard enough bunk. Out of my way. GERALT: I don't give a shit. Stop the execution! GUARD: Careful, wanderer. You could lose your tongue for that. I've heard of you and know you can fight, but you'll not take on the whole garrison. BYSTANDER: Oy! Tin man! That's pure rubbish! You're talkin' to the famed Geralt of Rivia, you are! GUARD: Commandant Loredo rules this town, and it's his orders I follow. Piss off, jesters, before I have you beaten good. ROCHE: You're a disgrace to your uniform, you shitty little idiot. GUARD: What?! Hey boys, lend me a hand here. Got an uppity little one that needs a thrashing! ROCHE: Take a swing, runt, I dare you... GUARD: Can't turn that down! Get 'em! Out of my way. The dwarf and the bard - I know them. GERALT: Stand aside. I know those two and I won't let them hang. GUARD: Piss on who you know. The law says they're to hang. Carry on and you'll join them. What are they accused of? [Same as \"What's going on here?\"] I've heard enough bunk. Out of my way. [Same as above.] [Geralt gets into a fistfight with two of the guards. The executioner hangs one of the elves; Geralt goes for the executioner and fistfights him to unconsciousness. Commandant Loredo approaches the podium.] LOREDO: What the hell is going on here?! LOREDO: I said, what the arse fuck is going on? GUARD: I- I- I'd like to re-re-report... LOREDO: Ou-ou-ou-ou-out of my sight, Clover! LOREDO: A few ploughing bandits and you can't even hang them! And you! Stay calm - hands off your sword. Our scaffold embraces speeches and hangings. Which will it be? The law's on our side. GERALT: You have no right to hang them. LOREDO: Interesting... because I'm the law in Flotsam. ROCHE: I take issue with that. Vernon Roche, officer of the King. LOREDO: Well, well... Blue Stripes, the nonhuman hunters. ROCHE: Precisely. Anyone suspected of collaborating with the Scoia'tael falls under my jurisdiction. GERALT: And Dandelion? What's he accused of? LOREDO: He burned down a watchtower. What's your jurisdiction say to that? I thought so. GERALT: Is that true? DANDELION: It might've looked that way... But I swear it wasn't my fault! I don't want trouble. GERALT: Your people started it. Short fuses, some of them. LOREDO: What do I care? They started, but you finished. GERALT: I had to defend my friends. Will you release them? LOREDO: Terrible choice of friends, witcher. Who are you? GERALT: Are you in command here? LOREDO: Forgive me! Bernard Loredo, Commander of Port Flotsam. Yes, I rule this brothel... The law's on our side. [Same as above.] I don't want trouble. [Same as above.] LOREDO: I'd rather give you a thief. Relax, I'm joking... I hate thieves. We can put on another show - bloody and serious this time, mind you - or we can come to an understanding. GERALT: Meaning? LOREDO: Give me a minute, witcher. LOREDO: Listen here. You may have heard rumors of the tragic events that transpired during the siege of La Valette Castle. Sadly, they are true. King Foltest is dead. It's likely that Scoia'tael had a hand in this heinous murder. So, you see, none of you can feel safe. That is why today, wagons with armaments will roll out into Flotsam's streets. I hereby declare a state of emergency. Await orders, prepare to fight, and ready yourselves to avenge your fallen king. Now disperse, go to your homes. Dandelion and Zoltan are free? GERALT: What about them? LOREDO: They'll not hang for now. Let's say I'm reconsidering their cases... The scaffold's no place for civil conversation. We'll talk at my home. Your friends are free for the time being, but they're not to leave town. LOREDO: Come after dusk. Hm, I'll be busy until then. There's one more thing... LOREDO: Welcome to Flotsam, witcher. Nice show. GERALT: Nice speech. You might as well have said outright that nonhumans slew Foltest... LOREDO: My subjects know exactly who their enemy is. Out in that forest, grow careless for a moment and you're a dead man. GERALT: Whereas the nonhumans here in town are all friendly. LOREDO: Friendlier than the merciless bastards out there. We let the Scoia'tael inside and they'll skin us alive, just before they slit our throats. Here, even the slightest sense of safety is an illusion. We'll not succumb to it for a moment. [Continues the same as \"Dandelion and Zoltan are free?\"] . [Dandelion and Zoltan are freed from the nooses.] . DANDELION: Ah. They were really going to hang us. I... I... I don't know... I didn't mean to torch that watchtower. GERALT: Everything's all right, Dandelion. Let's get out of here. ZOLTAN: Oh we owe, we owe you, Geralt. Thank you. ZOLTAN: Time to hit the tavern. Come on, Dandelion, you need a stiff drink. And while we're at it, I'll tell you an edifying tale of local hypocrisy that conceals lechery 'neath a veneer of courtesy. Except nothing can hide the stench. [Geralt joins his friends in the tavern.] DANDELION: Ha-hah! Damn, that was close... Innkeep! Vodka! ZOLTAN: Triss Merigold! Lice eat me, but you are a treat to behold! Ah, just a little pale... TRISS: Magic takes its toll, but I'll be all right. Good to see you and your beard again. GERALT: Can somebody tell me what happened? You set off a month ago for Zoltan's wedding... ZOLTAN: That got fucked. There will be no wedding. GERALT: Did you hear about Foltest? DANDELION: Rumors travel faster than the wind. ZOLTAN: Winds and rumors! I want to know the truth. DANDELION: I want to know how Foltest died. And the dragon - was there really one there? And who rules Temeria now? GERALT: Dandelion, calm down - you'll choke on your liquor. The dragon... GERALT: The dragon... Well, the dragon appeared, and that's all I know. DANDELION: But where did the La Valettes get a dragon?! We heard it fought on their side! Huge as a barn, they say. GERALT: Dragons don't usually take sides. Maybe its lair was nearby and it just felt threatened. TRISS: If you hadn't driven it off, Foltest might not have taken the castle. GERALT: Maybe. We'll never know for sure. What's with the wedding, Zoltan? GERALT: No wedding, Zoltan? ZOLTAN: Hah! The Breckenriggs broke off the engagement because some limp prick put it about that I joined the uprising in Vizima. My would-be pop-in-law refused to let a rebel firebrand join the family... Innkeep! Where's our drink?! DANDELION: It was like this... We got to Mahakam a week after the Grand Master died. Bought Zoltan an absolutely grand doublet, a pair of Geribuldi crackowes and, as a gift for Eudora, a jadestone as big as my fist. ZOLTAN: We were broke as a joke by the time Dandelion threw me a bachelor party at an establishment called 'The Tight Lane.' DANDELION: Next day we went over to the Breckenriggs'. They welcomed us in, sat us down, and proceeded to discuss the superiority of Mahakaman mining know-how over any other. And that went on until dinner. Just when I thought I'd learned more than I ever wanted to know about mining, they served the soup... ZOLTAN: You could've heard a pin drop. Old Breckenrigg rose and he says, 'A real dwarf works a mine, not chases fame on the battlefield.' DANDELION: You'll never believe this, Geralt, but they served duck blood soup! It was as black as tar. They must've dropped lumps of coal into the pot. ZOLTAN: Eat,' Breckenrigg says, then proceeded to slurp two full bowls of the shite. Old goat. Hope his mine caves in on his head. Dandelion, since when have you worked for Roche? GERALT: Since when have you worked for Roche? DANDELION: Hey, nobody said a word when you went out to save Temeria from the Grand Master and his mutants. GERALT: Relax, Dandelion. I was just asking. Do what you want. You're an adult... kind of. ZOLTAN: Bua-ha-ha-ha-haaaaa-ha! TRISS: That wasn't very supportive. DANDELION: Laugh away... At least I decided to do something constructive. GERALT: You used to spy for Redania, now you're spying for Temeria. Some might call you a traitor. DANDELION: Ever tried to live off of poetry alone? The truth is, I'm a citizen of the world. As long as I don't serve Emperor Emhyr, I'm not doing any harm. ZOLTAN: Leave him be, Geralt. He'll play the spy a bit, get bored, and drop it. You know how he is. Have you joined the Scoia'tael, Zoltan? GERALT: Loredo said you're working with the Scoia'tael, Zoltan. ZOLTAN: I have done many things in my life, Geralt, but I've never stooped to banditry. GERALT: The Scoia'tael don't consider themselves bandits. ZOLTAN: But I am no Scoia'tael. Triss, tell us what happened after I was arrested. GERALT: Triss, you're the expert on Temeria... tell us who's in charge now. TRISS: It's chaotic and getting worse. The old families are fighting for supremacy, no holds barred. DANDELION: Baron Kimbolt and Count Maravel, I bet... TRISS: Among others. After the assassination, while Geralt was in the dungeon, the lords convened in a field near La Valette Castle to choose a new ruler. Three days they debated and it looked more like a bazaar than a meeting of nobles. Except the trade was in court and ministry positions, spheres of influence, royal privileges... ZOLTAN: Thah! Humans! TRISS: In spite of several duels and two poisonings, no king was chosen. Civil war was in the air. No mages around to cool things down? GERALT: Where were the mages? ZOLTAN: Aye! Where were the gray eminences of this world when they were truly needed? TRISS: They weren't invited. Neither was I. But if not for their intervention, or rather that of a few influential sorceresses, Baron Kimbolt would've taken the throne... DANDELION: I was invited to sing at his court once. Afterwards, he refused to pay me, and the food was awful. No way I'll stay in Temeria if he's crowned. Was there any resolution? GERALT: Did they ultimately resolve anything? TRISS: No. It ended as usual...Sadly, John Natalis remains our only hope. DANDELION: Ah, the victor at Brenna and Foltest's most tried and true field commander. TRISS: Hmm. During the deliberations, he was several days' march from La Valette lands - with an additional two thousand armed men in tow. He's to keep the peace until a rightful monarch is chosen. DANDELION: He could find that ruling is to his liking. TRISS: Natalis is a soldier at heart. He's not suited to rule and I don't believe he even wants to. ZOLTAN: He's got the army behind him... TRISS: Which is why he can guarantee peace. A tenuous one, sure, but that's always better than civil war. Besides which, he's deeply in debt to a dwarven bank in which Philippa Eilhart, a sorceress, holds a significant stake. That's enough politics. About the King... GERALT: Foltest's killer lay in wait in the tower where the La Valettes had hidden the royal bastards. He was well-informed. DANDELION: Wait a minute. What were you doing there? GERALT: I was protecting the King. After the first attempt, Foltest began treating me as his lucky charm. He ordered me to be at his side during the battle. The dragon separated us from the rest of the army. The killer disguised himself as a monk, a blind one at that. He let Foltest greet his children, waited until I had walked off, then cut the king's throat from ear to ear. ZOLTAN: How did he flee? GERALT: Jumped out a window into the river below. Iorveth's Scoia'tael were waiting in a boat - it was planned. DANDELION: And you're chasing him because he murdered the King? GERALT: I was accused of the murder. I need to clear my name. Besides, I looked him in the eye before he escaped... He's a witcher. Then some brave Temerian soldiers showed up, piled on me, and knocked me out... [A man bursts into the tavern.] MAN: Save yourselves, good folk! The beast attacks! TRISS: We better get out there... Someone's casting spells. [A tentacle writhes around the docks, striking bystanders. A mage casts a lightning spell at it, and it retreats.] DOCK WORKER: What sort of sorceress are you?! A lot of good you did. Can't you hear me?! Why didn't you help him? SÍLE: He's alive, isn't he? DOCK WORKER: The beast nearly pulled him in the water, while you stood staring like a calf at a shit-covered clover! SÍLE: Watch your words. [Geralt and Triss approach.] GERALT: Where's this beast? DOCK WORKER: Ask her! SÍLE: Geralt? GERALT: Ah, I guess we knew each other. DOCK WORKER: Oh, lookey here, birds of a feather... SÍLE: Let's say... I've heard of you. DOCK WORKER: Master witcher, this is foolish. The beast near pulled Sosek into the depths, and you're simply chatting with this damsel! Butt out. Sosek's alive, isn't he? GERALT: Sosek's alive and nowhere near the depths. The monster's vanished without a trace. DOCK WORKER: You best take us seriously, lest you vanish without a trace. Right. About the monster... GERALT: All right. What happened? SÍLE: I came to Flotsam to kill the kayran. DOCK WORKER 2: Kayran? SÍLE: The monster that has effectively blocked the port. A moment ago, I had the good fortune to see it in all its splendor, but the local folk scared it away. DOCK WORKER 3: Good fortune? You hear that, Sosek? That was some good fortune for you! DOCK WORKER 2: Why's the beast in the port all of a sudden, eh? Summoned by the witch, perchance? DOCK WORKER 1: To see it in all its splendor! Care to fight the monster yourselves? GERALT: And which of you is ready to help the sorceress fight the beast? DOCK WORKER 2: Why us? Huge it is! Big as a mountain! GERALT: Then why get angry at someone who's willing? DOCK WORKER 2: Well, 'cause... GERALT: We'll tend to the kayran, the sorceress or I. Maybe we'll do it together. We'll draw it away from the port beforehand, so as not to endanger the likes of you. DOCK WORKER 1: Well, I hope you succeed. I've no preference for who does it - witch or witcher... just kill the whoreson and the whole town will be grateful. [INTIMIDATION] Get out of my face. GERALT: I'm tired of your whining. Get out of here. [FAILURE] DOCK WORKER 1: I'm to go? Not likely. You get your arse out of Flotsam, wanderer! [SUCCESS] DOCK WORKER 1: Ah, as ever, it's the common folk that get ploughed. Come on, lads. DOCK WORKER 2: *Ptooey!* [AXII] You need to get Sosek out of here. GERALT: Sosek doesn't look too good. Lay him inside somewhere. [FAILURE] DOCK WORKER 1: Oh, you tryin' that black magic on me? Come on, lads, this sorcerer's eager for a thrashin'! [SUCCESS] DOCK WORKER 1: Right, we've dawdled enough already. Come on, lads, let's go. DOCK WORKER 3: What's this? I was ready for a rumble, there. DOCK WORKER 1: Shut it, and come on. Tell me about the monster... [Same as \"Right. About the monster...\"] [A man in fine clothing approaches.] MERSE: I apologize for interrupting, but I am Louis Merse, and I am chief person in charge of all matters related to monster-hunting in Flotsam. It is in this capacity that I must inquire if you're willing to attempt to resolve the problem of our so-called kayran - the beast that now blocks all trade traffic on the river. SÍLE: So, witcher? Are we willing? GERALT: I usually work alone... SÍLE: I was here first, and I'll not relinquish this contract. My way or the highway, as the locals put it... GERALT: Fine, your way it is. MERSE: You must contact the merchants on the waterfront as regards any rewards. Madame De Tansarville has, I believe, already conducted some preliminary negotiations... SÍLE: That, I have. MERSE: In that case, don't let me keep you. [Merse leaves.] SÍLE: Triss, how long must I wait for you to introduce us? TRISS: Síle de Tansarville, advisor to Queen Zulika of Kovir. GERALT: Kovir's a long way north. SÍLE: True. I had my doubts if the kayran was worth the journey, but those were dispelled with what it showed today. TRISS: Here to hunt down some ingredients? SÍLE: Triss Merigold - sharp as ever. GERALT: You're thinking that...? SÍLE: Troll eyes, ghoul venom, virgins' blood... All those disgusting marvels we take from dying species... To throw into the cauldron at sabbaths. Right, Triss? TRISS: Absolutely - virgins are a dying breed. SÍLE: Oh my! Your sense of humor seems to be intact, too. But enough of these pleasantries. Tell me, GERALT: you saw the tentacle - what do you make of it all? GERALT: The beast must be huge. Maybe inhabited one of the Pontar's tributaries before, hunting animals... Then it grew for some reason and hunger drove it to seek fresh pastures. SÍLE: And on the Pontar it found trade barges burgeoning with obese, slow-moving merchants. You're partly correct. Cedric claims the kayran emerged from the northern swamps approximately one month past. [If Cedric hasn't been met yet] GERALT: Cedric? SÍLE: An elf... Formerly a Scoia'tael. Strange bird, but he knows quite a bit about the area and its living wonders. GERALT: I need to look around, find out a few things... SÍLE: Hm, an investigation, witchers' rituals, extracting secrets and such... GERALT: More or less. I'll talk to the merchants about the reward, pay Cedric a visit and get back to you... SÍLE: You'll find me at the inn. I've rented lodgings there - on the upper floor. TRISS: You know the inn's also a whorehouse. SÍLE: Thanks for the warning. ",

MERCHANT: Ah, if only we had just one. Highway's washed out, forest's full of bandits, a river beast blocks the port and tolls are to rise! GERALT: Can't help with the tolls, but the monster's a possibility. MERCHANT: A sorceress said the same, but we've yet to see any results. GERALT: She's asked me to work with her. MERCHANT: And who's to pay your wage? GERALT: That's what I'm here to discuss. MERCHANT: The sorceress was to manage alone. You can split that reward if you wish. Where's our advance? GERALT: A contract like that requires preparations. Costly preparations. MERCHANT: You want an advance? I've but a handful of orens now, though it should buy you plenty of drink and a few hours of ploughing. GERALT: I was thinking of the potions we'll need... Double the fee and I'm in. GERALT: Well, we're managing it together now, so as I see it, you should double the reward... MERCHANT: Pghooh! You jest. I'll tell Síle you're looking to cheat her. GERALT: The sorceress might not know the going rates, but I'm a witcher. If she finds out you tried to cheat her, you'll have more than the kayran to fear. MERCHANT: Enough. Your meaning's clear. I shall add some gold, but the reward will not double under any circumstances. [AXII] You'll double the reward. GERALT: You'll double what you offered Lady de Tansarville, because that's what the contract's worth. [FAILURE] MERCHANT: I know what the contract's worth. And there's sufficient gold in it for you and the sorceress already. [Continues same as \"Where's our advance?\"] [SUCCESS] MERCHANT: So be it. I assume you to be professionals and worth every last copper paid to you. GERALT: It's a deal. [INTIMIDATION] Nuh-uh. GERALT: I never jest. [FAILURE] MERCHANT: In that case, two of you - two of us. We'll pay exactly what we promised and not a penny more. [Continues same as \"Where's our advance?\"] [SUCCESS] MERCHANT: A-a-all right. We shall increase the reward. You'll both be satisfied, I assure you. GERALT: It's a deal. Get back to me when you've had enough of Flotsam. [Same as below.] Get back to me when you've had enough of Flotsam. GERALT: Have it your way. But if the sorceress fails, you'll be stuck here with your goods till winter. Your losses would be far higher than the cost of hiring me. See you. MERCHANT: Uh, wait minute, there. No need to get cross. Time is coin - I understand that very well. If your participation will expedite the matter, so be it. We'll add two fistfuls of orens, though our pouches will be empty. Fine. GERALT: It's a deal. Gimme an advance. [Continues the same as \"Where's our advance?\"] GERALT: Now, tell me what you know about the beast. MERCHANT: You're the witcher, dammit. I've no knowledge of these things. GERALT: Who could tell me more? MERCHANT: That ploughing elf, Cedric, most probably. He's supposed to know all about monsters. [If Cedric hasn't been met yet] GERALT: Where can I find him? MERCHANT: In the village outside the walls. MERCHANT: Now leave me be. ",

Anyway, know where I can find an elf named Cedric? TRISS: Don't get involved in this. The merchants are putting up a lot of coin... GERALT: The merchants are paying good money for killing the beast. TRISS: Coin is never the most important thing. GERALT: Maybe. But it's still pretty useful. TRISS: I don't trust her. GERALT: Síle? Why not? TRISS: She's a powerful sorceress - dangerous to her foes. Even more dangerous to her friends. GERALT: I know you don't like her. Any specific reason? TRISS: I'm just trying to warn you. GERALT: Thanks. I guess I'll have to ask her. TRISS: How...? GERALT: We're going hunting together, right after I find Cedric. Afraid of Síle? GERALT: Hmm... You did turn pale when we met Síle. TRISS: You must've imagined that. If you don't want to talk, don't talk. GERALT: Never mind. I'll find out for myself. TRISS: How...? GERALT: We're going hunting together, right after I find Cedric. I know what I saw. GERALT: I know you too well. TRISS: Síle's one of the most powerful sorceresses. GERALT: That's no reason to fear her. TRISS: She can't be trusted - in my experience. I know her to be devious and manipulative. GERALT: Any proof? TRISS: She's well aware you lost your memory, yet pretended she didn't know. GERALT: Why would she do that? TRISS: I don't know. Her true intentions have always been hard to fathom. GERALT: I'll see if I can't learn what they are. TRISS: How? GERALT: I'll go hunting with her, right after I find Cedric. TRISS: Well, then let's go see him. He should be at the top of his observation tower. [Geralt follows Triss and climbs up a series of wooden platforms into a tree where two elves are conversing.] SEHERIM: Imbaelk. It'll be nearly a year now. CEDRIC: Moril would delight in a day like this, Seherim. Enjoy the memory of her, don't wallow in the longing. SEHERIM: I try, I do. But I cannot believe all the bad blood this disappearance has bred. CEDRIC: Don't let other Seidhe poison your memory of her. Hatred is but an outlet for helplessness. SEHERIM: Thank you, Cedric. Va fail. CEDRIC: Va fail. [Seherim departs, and Geralt greets Cedric.] GERALT: Are you Cedric? CEDRIC: Who asks? GERALT: Geralt of Rivia. CEDRIC: Ah, the witcher. And...? TRISS: Triss Merigold. CEDRIC: Lovely scent, Triss. GERALT: Cedric, look at me. CEDRIC: What do you want, Geralt of Rivia? I hunt monsters. GERALT: I'm looking to hunt in this area and I could use some advice. CEDRIC: I'm no witcher. I set traps, snares... try to keep nekkers away from Lobinden. That's all. GERALT: I'm aiming a little higher than nekkers. CEDRIC: The Old Man? Meaning the kayran? Finally, Loredo's splurged... Listen, I'm not one to teach your grandmother to suck eggs - you witchers know your work - but if you pay me, I can prepare a useful trap. GERALT: What kind of trap? CEDRIC: Puncturing trap, immobilizing trap, even decoys to pull monsters into an ambush. Whatever you like. Since I can easily finish off an ensnared nekker, it should be child's play for you. Who was Moril? GERALT: The elf woman you were talking about - how did she disappear? CEDRIC: Seherim believes the forest took her. GERALT: What do you believe? CEDRIC: Moril simply vanished, almost a year ago now. Some say she was too beautiful and dh'oine must have harmed her. GERALT: You believe that? CEDRIC: If I have no evidence before me, I try to trust my feelings. And they tell me the forest did not take her. GERALT: Why would you keep that from Seherim? CEDRIC: Because it's meaningless. Perhaps she was murdered, perhaps she departed on her own, never to return. She's gone - and neither I nor Seherim can reverse that. Who are you and what do you do here? GERALT: Who exactly are you? CEDRIC: One who warns humans against the dangers that lurk in the forest. GERALT: Care to clarify? CEDRIC: I am old, even for an elf. Yet the forest is older. I've lived in it for years and understand it, though it's nothing I can explain. At times I make mistakes, and people don't come home. GERALT: So you help humans... CEDRIC: I just know if it's safe to venture beyond the gates or not. Do I smell liquor? Are you drunk? GERALT: Maybe I'll come back when you're sober. CEDRIC: You witchers live a long life - you may, indeed, get to see that day. Know what the Squirrels want to achieve? GERALT: What are the Scoia'tael fighting for? CEDRIC: Do you ask about the old ones, who hoped to restore our race to its previous glory? Or about the young ones, who fight for survival and out of suicidal revenge? GERALT: Iorveth's warriors - which mold do they fit? CEDRIC: They believe they are still independent and that there is but one just way to view their cause. In truth, however, they're but a shadow of the Aen Seidhe's former glory. They cling to delusions to the very moment when a sword or a noose ends their life. Or until they realize the truth themselves. Which is, I believe, the worst. [Once the kayran is dead] What's the elven leader planning? GERALT: Any idea what Iorveth intends - towards Loredo or the local humans? CEDRIC: Only he knows that, but I suspect he's at a loss, unsure what to do. He's in the area, mounts the occasional ambush, then lies low for a few days. But he's yet to put together a larger attack. GERALT: I think he's waiting for the commandant to lower his guard. CEDRIC: It would appear so, but Iorveth is famous for his viciousness. He's fought regular troops, attacked much larger settlements. Delaying the fight this long is unlike him. Unless there's something I don't know about. I'm hunting the kayran. Can you help? GERALT: I aim to kill the kayran. Heard you might be able to help. CEDRIC: That depends on the sort of aid you seek. GERALT: I need information. CEDRIC: We should have killed it years ago. Now... Now, I don't know... The beast has become too large for the riverbed, and it has strange growths on its tentacles, extremely thick skin... Previously, it inhabited a swamp along one of the Pontar's tributaries. Completely wild terrain, even the Scoia'tael don't venture there. You should go see the wreck of the boat it recently sank. Inspect any traces it's left, see the destruction. GERALT: Where's this wreck? CEDRIC: Venture south into the forest, then turn east toward the river. You'll find the ruins of a bridge erected long ago by the Aen Seidhe. The wreck lies at their foot. GERALT: Thanks, Cedric. TRISS: You'll find me by the boat wreck. GERALT: Sheesh, Triss. Sure you're not overusing those teleports? [Geralt makes his way through the forest after Triss, fighting bandits on the way. He meets her at the top of the hill.] TRISS: I wonder what's left of that wreck Cedric mentioned. GERALT: If the kayran attacked the boat, it's not likely to be much. We're looking for traces of the beast, not boats. [They drop down a series of cliff ledges towards the wreck. Geralt notices footprints.] GERALT: See those footprints? TRISS: Yeah. Strange place for an evening walk. GERALT: Unless you're looking for adventure... [They are ambushed by drowners by the water's edge.] TRISS: Drowners? GERALT: Nice to run into some old friends. TRISS: Almost brings a tear to your eye... GERALT: Let's examine the traces of the kayran and get out of here. [Nearby, Geralt finds a ram's corpse.] GERALT: A ram stuffed with sulfur and a dead cobbler - straight out of eastern legends. Not good enough for the kayran, though. [Under the roots of a gigantic tree, they find piles of green mucus.] TRISS: Wait a minute. GERALT: What're you going to do? TRISS: Cast a simple diagnostic spell. It should answer a few questions. [Triss casts her spell.] TRISS: This monster's sick, Geralt... It's dying. GERALT: How much time does it have left? . TRISS: A few years, perhaps a decade and change... GERALT: Too long. What's wrong with it? Any information could be useful. TRISS: The diagnostic spell showed that some of the cells in its body have mutated... I'm a mutant. GERALT: What makes you think it's dying? I mean, I'm a mutant... TRISS: The mucus cells I diagnosed are very similar to cancer cells. In some ways, they're more effective than healthy cells, but they're out of control... They converge to create a red tissue - very unpleasant... GERALT: The poor thing. TRISS: But you brought up an interesting point. Want to know the core difference between mutants and non-mutants? Some other time. GERALT: Another time, maybe. [Continues the same as \"Anything else? Anything more specific?\"] Of course. GERALT: Of course I do. TRISS: The changes made through alchemy and magic in your body would require thousands of years to develop on their own. This development would result from genetic errors that would cause your body to adapt, become a more efficient organism - effectively mutate, but over a very long time. When this development occurs over millennia, across multiple generations, we proudly call it natural selection, evolution. When it occurs quickly, in a single organism or a few representatives of a species, we frown on it as mutation. GERALT: And here I thought you liked me. [Continues the same as \"Anything else? Anything more specific?\"] Anything else? Anything more specific? GERALT: What else? TRISS: The kayran's highly venomous. GERALT: Any ideas for an antidote? TRISS: Your witcher's metabolism should neutralize small doses of the toxin, but if I were you, I wouldn't rely on my mutations alone. An ostmurk potion should do the trick. GERALT: I know the herb but haven't the faintest where I might find it around here. I need to think, figure out how I want to fight the kayran. Maybe I won't need the potion. TRISS: Do what you will, but don't say I didn't warn you. Síle might be eager to get this done, but before you go see her, ask some of the locals about ostmurk. You could try Cedric. Here's the formula for the potion. I need to take care of some things. Manage without me for a while? GERALT: Mhm. TRISS: See you. ",

Come back after dusk. [As requested, Geralt goes to Loredo's home after dark.] GUARD: What? GERALT: The Commandant wanted to see me. GUARD: Leave your weapon here. GERALT: Guard it with care. It's very valuable. [Before Geralt can go in, Roche walks up.] ROCHE: Wait, Wolf. I need to talk to the Commandant, too. GUARD: You going inside or not? ROCHE: Listen, friend, I'm an officer and you're a runt. And when I say jump, you will not only... GERALT: Come on, Roche. [Inside Loredo's compound, soldiers are enjoying themselves around a series of campfires.] ROCHE: With these cunts, Loredo couldn't protect the port from a drunk lumberjack, let alone Iorveth. GERALT: He's succeeded so far, Roche. ROCHE: The port is rotting away and this prick throws fireside feasts... [A little further in, Roche catches sight of a war machine.] ROCHE: A ballista. The bastard's got a ballista. You know the power of this weapon? GERALT: Mhm. ROCHE: Its arms strengthened with bronze plates and strung with horsehair, it can propel heavy bolts up to a mile away. GERALT: Yeah, an experienced crew can release two bolts each minute, but it can't hit the same spot twice because it recoils and shifts. I've heard that somewhere before. ROCHE: Where did you learn about ballistae? GERALT: I knew someone who knew a bit about them. ROCHE: Unimportant. We need to damage it if we don't want to be at Loredo's mercy. They're all drunk here now. I'll provoke the guard... GERALT: Relax, Roche. I don't want to fight this rabble again. ROCHE: As long as that weapon's operational, no one will sail this section of the Pontar without Loredo's express permission... GERALT: I'll handle this. Go have a drink. ",

Ugly...? GERALT: Ugly? MARGARITA: Well, you ain't exactly handsome. GERALT: But... MARGARITA: I wouldn't worry. Women prefer ugly men to groomed dandies. And you're ugly something mighty. Care for a romp? GERALT: Can't just now, but I'll find you later in town. What's your name? MARGARITA: Margarita. I wanted to surprise my friend. GERALT: I wanted to surprise my friend... The sad-looking guy by the ballista. MARGARITA: Some idiot wanted me to read him poems recently... Extravagance, as I see it. I didn't like it. GERALT: I was thinking of something a little more traditional. MARGARITA: What would you have me do? Your specialty. GERALT: Just go with your specialty. MARGARITA: All right. It'll be my standard rate. GERALT: Draw him away from the ballista, while you're at it. MARGARITA: Slap me hard and call me stupid! Tryin' to put one by me? That'll cost you more. GERALT: How's that? MARGARITA: Surcharge on special requests. Those are the rules... GERALT: Lemme think it over. [Same options to continue as \"You choose.\"] You choose. GERALT: I don't really care. Just get him away from the ballista. MARGARITA: Oh, now you got me doubting he's your mate at all. But I'll not pry. It'll cost you double. GERALT: That's steep. MARGARITA: I may be a simple girl, but I know at least a few men who'd give you trouble if I told them what you've asked of me... Pay me and it’ll stay between us. I mean no point in giving brutes and louts a good reason to perfect their skills, eh? Any other way I could convince you? GERALT: A favor for a favor?

Why should you be any worse? GUARD: You're right. Let's go. MARGARITA: How was it? GUARD: With tits like that you could conquer all Temeria, darlin'!

[Geralt and Roche go up the steps to Loredo's house, but are turned away.] GUARD: Loredo's busy with that witch, Síle. Come back later. ROCHE: Geralt, let's wait downstairs in the yard... ROCHE: Yes? [If Geralt has not sabotaged the ballista yet] Got any idea how to get rid of the guard by the ballista? GERALT: How did you plan to get rid of the guard by the ballista? ROCHE: I have my ways. But you wanted to do it alone, so go talk to the buffoon. GERALT: Do we wait until the honorable lady is done with the venerable hick? ROCHE: Waste of time, Looks like a good number of Flotsam's town watchmen are here... We should look around... Did you see that arbalist behind the house? ROCHE: I'll get his attention, give him something to think about. Why don't you find out what they're guarding so closely. [If the kayran hasn't been killed yet] MAN: My apologies, gentlemen, I could not help overhearing your conversation... ROCHE: What do you want? MAN: In point of fact, it's a matter for the witcher. I have an offer... Let me hear it. GERALT: An offer... Interesting. MAN: I suspect you did not come to Flotsam for pleasure alone... GERALT: You suspect right. MAN: Do you know about the monster in the river? Maybe. GERALT: Might've heard something. MAN: I expect someone will hire you to deal with it sooner or later. Thus, I presume that... GERALT: Stop presuming, expecting and concluding. Just tell me what you want. MAN: Our honored host is in possession of part of a trap, built especially for the beast in question. GERALT: Go on... MAN: Around back there's a storage area where Loredo keeps the treasures he confiscates from merchants and travelers. There are heaps of things out there... GERALT: Let me guess, you know exactly where I need to look. MAN: Precisely. I saw Loredo's men carrying the contraption across the garden in a crate. They placed it on a platform by the wall beyond which lies the craftsmen's district. GERALT: Why are you telling me? MAN: Why, we need to be rid of the beast as soon as possible! Good luck! Not a thing. GERALT: What monster? [Continues the same way as \"Maybe\".] Not now. [EXIT] ROCHE: All right, I'll distract the guard. You sneak behind the house. GERALT: Brilliant as ever. [Roche calls out to the guard around the side of the house.] ROCHE: Soldier! Report to me immediately! SOLDIER: What do you want? ROCHE: Shut it, soldier. Have respect for your superiors or spend the rest of your life on the king's galley. SOLDIER: Apologies, sir, I didn't realize... ROCHE: As I see it, the entire garrison could use a lesson in discipline. Isn't that right? SOLDIER: Sir! ROCHE: That's the attitude, soldier. The Commandant will hear of this. [Geralt sneaks around. Through the windows next to the first guard, Loredo's mother can be seen mumbling to herself and puttering around what appears to be a fisstech lab.] MARIETTA: The coca leaf will rid you of grief... MARIETTA: Dispel the dark spider's web of dreams... MARIETTA: La-da-dah, la-dah, da-da-da-doo... MARIETTA: Marietta, pretty little Mary, has found a treasure trove.. MARIETTA: Leaves upon leaves, a coca plant grove... La-da-dum, da-dum, da-da-da-dum, -da-dum... [Geralt manages to peek through one of the windows and overhear Loredo and Síle's conversation.] SÍLE: You forget who you're dealing with, Commandant. LOREDO: You must think me an idiot. SÍLE: I cannot help myself. You take guardsman off the streets to guard carpets, fabrics and spices pilfered from merchants. Do you have any grasp of the responsibility that rests with you? LOREDO: Don't teach an old man to piss, sorceress. I've ruled Flotsam for years. SÍLE: Flotsam is ruled by a fear of Iorveth. That fear rules even you. LOREDO: I've made my demands perfectly clear. SÍLE: Like a crying babe deprived of its rattle. In time, Commandant, they'll hang you by the neck from a roadside tree like a regular bandit. And rightly so, for you're no better. LOREDO: Your time will come too, sorceress. They'll pile kindling at your feet. SÍLE: Enough! Fear has confused you. Think over what I said and give your answer before it's too late. [Geralt retrieves the part for the kayran trap and heads back to Roche.] ROCHE: Didn't like him from the start. GERALT: Loredo's storing valuable 'gifts' from the merchants right here. He may be expecting Iorveth to attack. That's not all... GERALT: I overheard the Commandant talking to Síle. I couldn't pinpoint the topic of their conversation, but it seems to me he's angling for something. Let's go. GERALT: Let's pay the Commandant a visit. ROCHE: We'll see what he has to say. [Geralt and Roche go up the steps.] GUARD: Go in - they await you. ROCHE: Where are we to go? I'd hardly call this a hut. GUARD: You, I mean, you sir, cannot enter. We've been ordered to let in the witcher but no one else. ROCHE: Son of a bitch! Fine - he wants to play hard, we'll play hard. GUARD: I don't want any trouble. I'll call for support! ROCHE: No need. Tell Loredo I got the message. GERALT: See you, Roche. [Geralt runs into Síle in the hall.] SÍLE: Here to see the Commandant? GERALT: We have business to discuss. SÍLE: Good luck... He's in a foul mood. GERALT: Why? SÍLE: We'll talk another time, and definitely elsewhere. [If Geralt is caught sneaking] GUARD: In Flotsam, we cut the hands off thieves... GERALT: I was looking for the privy. GUARD: You're lucky the Commandant wants to see you. Come on. [The guard brings Geralt in to see Loredo.] GUARD: Commandant, sir, we caught the witcher sneaking around the garden. LOREDO: Bring him in and leave! GUARD: Yes, sir! SÍLE: We were just discussing a certain matter. You here on business, too? GERALT: The Commandant wanted to see me. SÍLE: In that case, I shall leave you to it. LOREDO: Finally! GERALT: They didn’t want to let me in... while the sorceress was here. LOREDO: Did you see her? Made up like a whore on parade day. They think they can do anything, those sorceresses. LOREDO: I heard what happened in Temeria. You know your name's on a warrant? It's unfortunate... though nothing that should impede our dealings. See, I'm the law around here, and the law needs to know what the legendary White Wolf's doing in this cesspit. Nothing specific. GERALT: I'm a witcher. I hunt monsters for coin. [Continues same as \"LOREDO: I suppose we all have our secrets.\"] That's my business. GERALT: That's no concern of yours. LOREDO: Listen, witcher - here in Flotsam, everything's my ploughing concern. Let me help you, Geralt. I don't need your help. GERALT: I do all right on my own. LOREDO: I suppose we all have our secrets. I just hope you resist questioning my authority in public again. What do you want from me? GERALT: Let's talk business, Commandant. [Continues same as from \"LOREDO: I trust you're on our side?\"] Why don't you trust Roche? GERALT: What about Vernon Roche? Why didn't you let him in? LOREDO: Roche? Know the aura that surrounds him? Men like him act first and think later. And when they act, almost inevitably innocent blood flows. [Continues same as from \"LOREDO: I trust you're on our side?\"] I'm looking for the kingslayer. GERALT: I'm looking for the man responsible for Foltest's death. LOREDO: Here? GERALT: I know the Scoia'tael had a hand in it, too. It's their trail I followed to Flotsam. LOREDO: Lucky you found Bernard Loredo, then. If you're telling the truth, Iorveth's got royal blood on his hands. I can help you find him. Why don't you trust Roche? [Same as above.] Iorveth's not my target. GERALT: The kingslayer - that's who I want. Huge man, pretty hard to mistake. LOREDO: Was it him...? GERALT: Yeah, he killed Foltest. Now he's sneaking around these woods. LOREDO: In that case, we'll get him, too. [If the kayran is dead] LOREDO: I heard you killed the kayran. Flotsam is grateful. LOREDO: Let's say that squares the crimes of your friends. They're free to go. LOREDO: I trust you're on our side? GERALT: Whose side is that? LOREDO: That of the people of Flotsam, of course. Terrorized by the elven bandits for years now. Bandits deserve no mercy. GERALT: My enemy's enemy is my friend. We barely escaped with our lives the last time we ran into Iorveth. LOREDO: Damned Squirrels draw ever nearer. What about the nonhumans in Flotsam? GERALT: What about the elves and dwarves in the trading post - the smiths, peddlers and hunters? They eat with you, sleep among you. Whose side are they on? LOREDO: Hell if I know. That's my point, witcher - when you fight for survival, you need to be sure who your friends are. LOREDO: The nonhumans in Flotsam... Sure, they eat, fuck, shit among us, but when Iorveth sounds the battle horns, who knows what they'll do. They chose Flotsam. GERALT: They haven't proved their loyalty already, placing walls between Iorveth and themselves? LOREDO: They understand that bandit, witcher. They share his language, his methods, his beliefs. We let them live among us, but we watch them. One night, they just might cut our throats and open the gates. GERALT: Talk like that makes me sick. Treat them better, and they'll show you loyalty. GERALT: I'm surprised they haven't turned on you already. LOREDO: How so? GERALT: The town guards treat nonhumans like shit. Frankly, I don't know what keeps them here. LOREDO: I'll tell you what, Geralt - the hunger they'd face in the forest. But I grant you, those acts of, uh, insubordination need to be stopped. Soldiers are simple men. When you see your mate die, a Scoia'tael arrow in his throat, it's hard to look favorably at the elf who sells your wife colored kerchiefs. They could stand with Iorveth. GERALT: Iorveth talks about driving off the dh'oine, he calls the elder races superior. I wouldn't be surprised if some of the poorer nonhumans secretly support him. LOREDO: Right you are. As long as Iorveth remains weak, they're afraid to join him. But what happens if he gains strength? Woe to Flotsam, I say. [All continue with \"LOREDO: You're a witcher.\" below.] What's your point, Loredo? GERALT: Your point, Commandant? [Continues with \"LOREDO: You're a witcher.\" below.] I don't want to get involved in that. GERALT: A local conflict. None of my business. LOREDO: You killed some elves on the riverbank outside Flotsam. GERALT: We were attacked. [Continues with \"LOREDO: You fail to understand...\"] Geralt choice: You have only yourselves to blame. GERALT: There was a time those forests belonged to the elves. To them, humans are bandits. LOREDO: Spare me your sympathy! The elder races, the elder language - plough it all! Today, they torch human settlements, they poison our wells and they murder us along the highways. [Continues with \"LOREDO: You fail to understand...\"] LOREDO: You fail to understand... GERALT: It's you who doesn't understand, Loredo. To tell you the truth, I'm not human. LOREDO: You an elf? A dwarf? No. Y'talking bollocks... I piss on the fact that they call you 'freak' for your white hair and glowing eyes. You're a human like any other. LOREDO: We're fighting a war. And you, my friend, cannot straddle the fence. And the nonhumans in Flotsam? [Same as \"What about the nonhumans in Flotsam?\"] LOREDO: You're a witcher. Your job is to protect the simpletons from monsters. I protect them from the danger that lurks amongst the trees. Untrue, you're just a racist. GERALT: You detest nonhumans. LOREDO: I detest Iorveth, the coward who hunts the innocent instead of facing soldiers. I detest that whoreson who murders women and children while claiming that he fights for freedom! He's a monster, Geralt. He's the evil I protect people from. And anyone who helps a monster becomes a similar monster to my mind. GERALT: Enough. I get it. You mean Iorveth. GERALT: I see where this is going. LOREDO: Iorveth's no better than a monster that attacks those who go out to gather kindling. Matter of fact, he's worse - he's smarter and crueler. GERALT: How do we get him? LOREDO: I don't want you to kill him. Even you don't have a hope against his entire force. LOREDO: I've an idea, but I'd rather not go into it now. The Squirrels are up to something. Every night their scouts come closer. I suspect they plan to attack the barge moored in the port. A barge? GERALT: What's on the barge? LOREDO: You mean who. Bandits, murderers, rapists - on their way to the dungeons at Drakenborg, as soon as... GERALT: Their infamous leader joins them. The cherry on the cake, and Bernard Loredo's crown trophy. LOREDO: Couldn’t have put it better myself. What should I do? GERALT: What do you want me to do? LOREDO: As long as Iorveth remains free, humans, elves and dwarves will live alongside each other in deep distrust. I've got to learn what the pointy-eared rat is planning. GERALT: How am I supposed to get that information? LOREDO: Ha! You underestimate me, witcher. True, I have my prejudices, but I'm not blinded by them. LOREDO: Take your friend, Zoltan, for instance - he contacted Iorveth. [If the kayran isn't dead] GERALT: How can Zoltan help if he can't go outside the walls? LOREDO: Hah! Step by step, Geralt, that's how you build trust. LOREDO: You could start by tending to a problem we have. A beast, the kayran, has blocked all boat traffic. I'm losing tolls, that is, uh, the trading post is losing revenue. Kill the kayran and I'll declare your friends acquitted of their crimes. Then Zoltan can take you to see Iorveth. There must be a reward on Iorveth's head. What's it up to these days? GERALT: I'm a witcher. I don't work for free. LOREDO: Course you don't. Help us capture the Scoia'tael commander and you'll be rewarded generously, straight from the trading post's treasury. It's a deal. [Same as below.] Sorry, no deal. [Same as below.] It's a deal. GERALT: I'll see what I can find out. LOREDO: Though you stir up storms wherever you go, I actually believe you'll bring peace to Flotsam. Don't disappoint this town, Geralt. I'll see what I can do. GERALT: I'll talk to Zoltan. LOREDO: I trust you'll make the right decision. Sorry, no deal. GERALT: I came and heard you out. Now I've heard enough. LOREDO: You're refusing to help? GERALT: You're vile, Loredo. I hope you and Iorveth face each other someday, and may the best rat win. LOREDO: You'll regret those words, witcher! I promise you that. Now get outta my sight! LOREDO: Farewell. [If Geralt rejected him outright, he says nothing.] [Geralt leaves Loredo's estate. If the kayran is still alive, Geralt can find the man who gave him the tip about the trap.] [If Geralt was caught by guards] MAN: What happened? GERALT: You neglected to mention the regiment of guards... They caught me. MAN: Lucky we're all in mourning... I mean, otherwise they would've hung you on the spot. [If Geralt got the trap part] MAN: Success? GERALT: I still need a few things, but you helped me a lot. MAN: You'll find me at the market. Best of luck, witcher. ",

    "content": "&lt; PREV CONTENTS NEXT &gt; [After making his preparations, Geralt goes to see Síle in her room above the tavern.] SÍLE: Witcher, I've been awaiting you. GERALT: We need to kill a monster that sinks boats. SÍLE: Afraid? GERALT: No, but I suspect we'll need to draw it onto the shore. SÍLE: Leave that to me. GERALT: I can't wait... I bet it's something spectacular. SÍLE: Believe it. You'll do the honors. GERALT: The honors? SÍLE: Once on the riverbank, you'll kill him... her... whatever it is. The kayran - any idea where it came from? GERALT: Did you find out where the kayran came from? SÍLE: I didn't even try. GERALT: So I take it you know it was created by a mage. SÍLE: I guessed as much. And what of it? Do you wish me to feel guilty, apologize for some madman? I don't intend to. How did you know it was a mage? GERALT: I didn't. Just guessed. There's magic in that beast. GERALT: Triss claims the kayran was born of magic. SÍLE: She's right. Something that large couldn't possibly evolve in the waters of the Pontar. It looks like the result of some botched experiment... It's growing rapidly and will probably age just as quickly. Can we talk about something besides business? GERALT: If we're going to work together, we should get to know each other. SÍLE: Is that so? Very well... Ask what you will. You and Triss know each other well? GERALT: Are you and Triss friends? SÍLE: Friends...? Colleagues, I'd say. Acquaintances, perhaps. I know all the sorceresses in the North. We aren't that many in number. Which is why we support one another. You usually hunt monsters? GERALT: Do you always take on witchers' work? SÍLE: Occasionally. If it pays exceptionally well. You don't like the competition? I don't like amateurs. GERALT: We should each do whatever we're best at. SÍLE: Well... We'll have to see. I certainly hope I don't embarrass myself. Don't care either way. GERALT: It's no bother, as long as demand outweighs supply. SÍLE: Right. No, it's fine. I mean, I like you. GERALT: I like your kind of competition. SÍLE: Let's hope it works out for us both. I haven't traveled this far to have the kayran slip through my fingers now. Let's get to work. GERALT: No time to lose. SÍLE: Exactly. Count on me to prevent that from happening. GERALT: I won't let you down. Do you travel alone? GERALT: Traveling alone - that can't be pleasant. SÍLE: I've never needed protection. I have ways of dealing with unpleasant surprises. GERALT: What about pleasant surprises? SÍLE: Is that how you think of yourself, witcher? Are you suggesting I am? GERALT: You seem to see me that way. SÍLE: We'd best get to work. No one sees me that way. GERALT: People usually avoid witchers. SÍLE: Then I hope I don't regret my decision not to. [PERSUASION] You gotta learn for yourself. GERALT: There's only one way to find out. [FAILURE] SÍLE: Kill the kayran and you will have been. [SUCCESS] SÍLE: Kill the kayran, witcher. That's what's important now. [If you talked to Zoltan at the tavern] What did you hire Zoltan to do? GERALT: Zoltan told me you hired him to make something. SÍLE: Your dwarven friend has a way with stones. He helped repair my megascope. The set of the diamond must be very precise if it's to focus the light appropriately. That's quite a contraption. What is it? GERALT: What's that? It looks impressive. SÍLE: A megascope. GERALT: What does it do? SÍLE: Many complicated, magical operations. It allows me to communicate with other sorceresses, for instance. [If Geralt completed An Indecent Proposal] Got something going with the Commandant? GERALT: I never expected to see you at Loredo's. SÍLE: Whereas I was sure you would show up there. The Commandant is terribly jealous about his small trading post. Anyone of import is summoned to hear him out sooner rather than later. GERALT: What did he want from you? SÍLE: That is my concern, certainly none of yours. We're not a tandem, Geralt. We'll kill the kayran together, but that is all. See you. [EXIT] GERALT: I'll be ready soon. SÍLE: I certainly hope so. I'm ready. GERALT: I've got everything I need. Let's go. SÍLE: Excellent! [Scene cuts; Geralt and Síle are outside together in the forest.] SÍLE: Ready? GERALT: Are you wearing makeup? SÍLE: We all have our rituals. GERALT: From what I know kayrans are colorblind. SÍLE: Enough, Geralt. Time to draw the beast out of the water. GERALT: Got an ace up your sleeve? SÍLE: I always do. Don't get eaten and we'll soon both be heroes. GERALT: I hope you're right. [Síle goes to take her position on top of the bridge above the kayran's lair.] SÍLE: You descend into the lair. I'll stay on the bridge and pull it out onto the bank. Take care, it'll be extremely dangerous, even on land. [Geralt makes his way down to the lair. From her position, Síle casts a spell. The kayran erupts from the water and attacks. Geralt meets it in battle. As he does so, Síle shouts advice from above.] SÍLE: Use a Sign! Trap it with the Yrden! SÍLE: Yrden! Trap it with the Yrden! GERALT: You come down and trap it! SÍLE: It's angry! Watch out! SÍLE: Quickly! It's about to break free!! [Geralt severs the kayran's tentacles. As it thrashes, it damages the bridge, which collapses and traps the beast. Geralt runs up to its carapace and uses a bomb to kill the kayran.] SÍLE: We did it! Not a bad fight, wouldn't you say, Geralt? Are you all right? That was tough. GERALT: The beast got me a couple of times. SÍLE: I've heard you've been in more dire situations. I wonder, are the stories about you true? All of them without exception. GERALT: They couldn't be more true. Especially the ones that are made up. They're all lies. GERALT: People are always talking shit. SÍLE: That's how legends are born. Which ones? GERALT: What stories? SÍLE: If you think I'm going to repeat some of the legends circulating about you, you're deeply mistaken. GERALT: What now? SÍLE: I must harvest the most valuable ingredients while the corpse is fresh. I'd prefer to get the entire carcass to my laboratory and strip it down to the bone. But that would be a waste of Power and simply too much work. I shall take only... GERALT: What have you heard about me? SÍLE: A number of things. GERALT: You won't talk about them? SÍLE: I've no time, now. The fresher the ingredients I collect, the higher price I'll get. Sorry. I'm fine. GERALT: I'm fine. SÍLE: I've used up much of my energy, so if you needed help... GERALT: I've learned to help myself. Hm... a sorceress worried about me... Should I be scared? SÍLE: Playing it tough, like every witcher. I'm not playing anything. GERALT: New bruises and scars come with every fight. Toughness comes from experience. SÍLE: You talk like an old man. Yes, your hair is gray, but I believe the blood courses quickly through your veins. GERALT: Have you made plans that include me? SÍLE: For now, my plans only involve the kayran. What about the kayran? GERALT: I had no idea it'd be so big. SÍLE: Triss was right, it's mutated... magically induced. I must get to work, collect the most valuable ingredients. What a shame so much will go to waste. Forgive me, time is of the essence. GERALT: Farewell, then. SÍLE: Don't forget to collect the reward. GERALT: Oh, I won't. [Geralt collects his reward from the merchant.] GERALT: Job done. The kayran's dead. MERCHANT: Good work. You've earned your reward. [Geralt can, optionally, check back in with Loredo.] LOREDO: Any news for me, witcher? I killed the kayran. GERALT: I killed the kayran. Síle and I dragged it out of the water, toppled a piece of the bridge to weigh it down, and blew it up. LOREDO: I em... I heard... GERALT: So, Dandelion and Zoltan are free? LOREDO: As we agreed. Some garrison you have here. GERALT: You've got a heap of soldiers for such a small trading post. LOREDO: Bandits swarm to trading routes like flies to shit. Only troops can guarantee some order here. We're the last Temerian outpost in this area and we'll not give in to a bunch of elves. How long has Iorveth been bothering you? GERALT: I guess you're finding it hard to get rid of Iorveth. LOREDO: He's stubborn, it's true... but he's met his match. And I'm not about to leave Flotsam to the same fate as the other towns and villages the Scoia'tael have burned to the ground. LOREDO: The citizens of Flotsam owe the elves nothing. They built their homes and workshops with their own hands in the wilderness, not on the ruins of an elven town. If need be, we'll remind the long-ears where they belong. See you.

GERALT: It's people like him who might help us. TRISS: Or put us in shackles and throw us into the river. GERALT: He told me they're keeping Scoia'tael prisoners on a barge in the port. TRISS: Did he mention if Ciaran aep Easnillen, Iorveth's right hand elf, is among them? GERALT: No... TRISS: He may know something about the kingslayer. GERALT: Let's pay him a visit. [Geralt follows Triss to Loredo's prison barge.] GUARD: What do you want? GERALT: To speak with the wounded prisoner. [If you refused Loredo] GUARD: Very funny. Go on... away with you! TRISS: Commandant Loredo sent me to heal him. GUARD: Who are you? TRISS: A healer. GUARD: Healing elves? That don't sound like the Commandant. He's Iorveth's deputy and worth more alive... GERALT: He's Iorveth's second-in-command. GUARD: Even better if he kicks the bucket. GERALT: He's no use to us dead. He could know a lot. Loredo doesn't want him taking his secrets to the grave. TRISS: That's why he sent me. GERALT: All right. Just don't try anything stupid. [INTIMIDATION] Loredo himself issued the order. GERALT: Are you questioning orders? [FAILURE] GUARD: I only take orders from the Commandant, mongrel. [SUCCESS] GUARD: No... 'course not. You'll find him below deck. How does a pouch full of orens sound? GERALT: Would a pouch full of orens make it sound like the Commandant? GUARD: For that much you can even bugger him. Just make it quick. [If you agreed to help Loredo] GUARD: No one's allowed. GERALT: I'm here on Commandant Loredo's orders. GUARD: I heard he cut a deal with you, but... GERALT: So get out of my way. GUARD: He won't tell you much. He's dying. [Geralt and Triss board the barge and go down below to the cells.] GUARD 1: Shut your traps! Stop bloody moaning down there! GUARD 2: Look, Cougher's dozed off. GUARD 1: Wakey, wakey, Cougher. You'll fall asleep forever any day now. GUARD 2: Heh, heh, heh. GUARD 1: Look, Birdie's all wet. Hey, Birdie, you get wet just looking at me? GUARD 2: Get ready, Birdie, we'll be down to see you right after our watch. [Ciaran is laying prone in the back of the boat. Triss kneels to examine him.] TRISS: They beat him bad... He's got at least a dozen fractures. I'll need your help. GERALT: What do I do? TRISS: The spell I'm going to use is painful. It could kill him if he thrashes around. GERALT: I'll use the Axii Sign to calm him. TRISS: Perfect. [If you fail to cast Axii properly] CIARAN: AAAaarghhh...!!! TRISS: Focus, or you'll kill him! GERALT: Killing is a witcher's trade. TRISS: Let's try again. [Triss casts her spell.] GERALT: It's no use. CIARAN: You wish, whoreson. I'm no traitor. TRISS: He's raving. CIARAN: Vatt'ghern?! Where am I? TRISS: In Flotsam, on the prison barge. CIARAN: The convicts' barge...? I'm done for. We need to find Iorveth. GERALT: We need your help. We need to speak with Iorveth. CIARAN: Like hell, dh'oine. I'll tell you nothing. [Gives the same options to continue as below.] How did they catch you? GERALT: How did Loredo's goons catch Iorveth's right hand elf? CIARAN: I was betrayed, how else? [Gives the same options to continue as below.] We're fighting Loredo, like you. GERALT: We're fighting Loredo, too - a common goal. CIARAN: I once made the mistake of trusting dh'oine. Never again. We saved your life. GERALT: You'd be dying in pain if it wasn't for us. CIARAN: If it wasn't for the dh'oine, I wouldn't be here. There's a witcher among the Scoia'tael... GERALT: There's a witcher in Iorveth's unit. CIARAN: Like every dh'oine... he turned out to be a bastard. GERALT: What happened? CIARAN: He betrayed us... He said he had an offer for me. So we met - where roses of remembrance grow. I should have known... TRISS: Roses of remembrance? CIARAN: Yes, some of the last in the world. He thought that I'd betray my elven brother in order to control the unit. I refused, and there was a fight. CIARAN: I've never seen anything like it... No human can move that fast. It was a massacre. I was the first to be hit, thus I survived. I would have bled to death had Loredo's men not found me... Letho will kill Iorveth and all will be lost. So many dead, so much suffering, all for naught. This Letho is Foltest's killer? GERALT: Letho - he's the kingslayer? CIARAN: Yes. Why does Letho want Iorveth dead? GERALT: Why does the dh'oine want Iorveth dead? CIARAN: He used us. From the start. Our hatred... But he no longer needs Iorveth, sees him as a thorn in his side, though I don't know what Letho wants. What's Iorveth planning? GERALT: What does Iorveth want? Why Flotsam? CIARAN: Go plough yourself. [PERSUASION] Only I can warn Iorveth. GERALT: Only I can warn Iorveth. Tell me. [FAILURE] CIARAN: You would also betray him, dh'oine. [SUCCESS] CIARAN: He... we're fighting for much more, witcher. [Continues with \"CIARAN: Flotsam is only the beginning.\"] [INTIMIDATION] If I kill you, no one will help Iorveth. GERALT: You've got no choice. Tell me, or I'll kill you. [FAILURE] CIARAN: At least it will be an honorable death. [SUCCESS] CIARAN: No! If I die, Iorveth won't learn the truth! [Continues with \"CIARAN: Flotsam is only the beginning.\"] [AXII] Tell me. I'm on your side. GERALT: You have to tell me, I'm on your side. [FAILURE] CIARAN: Dh'oine magic tricks will never make me turn traitor! [SUCCESS] CIARAN: If you say so... [Continues with \"CIARAN: Flotsam is only the beginning.\"] CIARAN: Flotsam is only the beginning. We're no bandits, we fight for freedom. In due time, Iorveth will answer the call, and we'll emerge from the woods, joining the battle. GERALT: What battle? CIARAN: He wasn't specific. Your choice... GERALT: In that case, I'll ask Iorveth himself. CIARAN: Ugh. I'd like to see that. We've heard enough. Farewell. GERALT: We got what we came for. TRISS: What now? GERALT: Iorveth. TRISS: What if Iorveth already knows? GERALT: I've got an old saying all ready for him: my enemy's enemy is my friend. CIARAN: Warn him, Gwynbleidd. Iorveth fights, for that is what he does best. He's Aen Seidhe - a real one, a free one. Among the last... Fighting makes sense - now more than ever before. There is still hope. GERALT: What're you talking about, Ciaran? Hope for what? CIARAN: For change, for a better tomorrow... I'll not see it - they'll torment me to death on this barge and I'll go gladly where the apple trees bloom. But you must warn Iorveth. [Geralt experiences a flashback of himself and Yennefer on the island Ciri brought them to - and what happened when the Wild Hunt found them. NARRATOR: Yennefer told me that Ciri has departed for good. She inhabits another world and is happy there. Before she left this one, she gave us the Isle of Avallach. Our island... We stopped counting time. &nbsp; People believe that the wraiths of the Wild Hunt are immortal. They race across the heavens gripping in their bony hands swords that are lightning bolts. They take away mortals, ever expanding their cavalcade of spectral riders. They burned the orchard and the house. In their armored boots, they trampled our island. And they made off with Yennefer. &nbsp; I had to get her back, return to reality, return to the witcher’s Path.] TRISS: Geralt... Are you all right? GERALT: I've been to the Isle of Avallach, among the apple trees and the mists. After the massacre in Rivia, Ciri took me there, and Yennefer. The wraith riders kidnapped Yen, and I pursued them. TRISS: But... GERALT: Triss, this is important. I feel like everything's coming together. When the witchers found me barely alive a half year ago near Kaer Morhen, I was fleeing the wraiths of the Hunt. They continued to pursue me - in the Outskirts, then in Vizima when I killed the Grand Master... Now I know it was no coincidence. TRISS: Ciaran mentioned roses of remembrance, growing somewhere near here. Cedric claims likewise. If that's true... GERALT: Right now I should be searching the forest for Iorveth, not looking for flowers. TRISS: ...I could restore your memory. GERALT: You sure? TRISS: Everything seems to indicate that. Whatever's blocking your memory is clearly weakening. I think I could break that barrier with just one petal from a rose of remembrance. Those flowers are truly powerful. GERALT: In that case, Iorveth can wait. TRISS: Want me to go with you? I need to do this on my own. GERALT: I'll take care of this on my own. Wait for me in town. TRISS: I want to help... GERALT: I'll manage. TRISS: Uh-huh... GERALT: This won't take long. I'll ask some locals about the elven ruins, find the rose, and I'll be back. TRISS: I'll be waiting. It'd be nice if you did. GERALT: I'd love your company. TRISS: All right, then. Let's go. Cedric mentioned there are some old elven buildings near the cascade in the forest. We should start there. GERALT: Lead the way. ",

Know where I can find or buy one? ANEZKA: Not your lucky day, wanderer. Sold my last one, oh, three winters ago, must be. But earnestly, I received one a few years back from a huntsman who sought to make me his woman. He found it deep in the forest, where practically no one dares venture. GERALT: Even you? ANEZKA: Fate needs no tempting. The huntsman's long since dead, and he was a large, strong man who knew the forest well. I'm in no hurry to see the beyond. GERALT: Any idea who could tell me more? ANEZKA: Well, no one knows the wood better than Cedric. [Geralt goes to Cedric.] GERALT: I need a rose of remembrance. Can you help? CEDRIC: You speak of Eldan and Cymoril's bloom...Yes, Gwynbleidd, I know where they grow. GERALT: Where might that be? CEDRIC: In the garden of the eternal lovers... GERALT: Where's that?

I'll pay you back... [BRIBE] Here. [Not enough coin] CEDRIC: That's nowhere near enough, Gwynbleidd. I've debts to settle... And I really cannot manage sober. [SUCCESS] CEDRIC: Thanks, witcher. I shall repay you... Made a map once. Should be useful to you. Marked some interesting sites on it, Eldan and Cymoril's garden among them... GERALT: Thanks. Take this. GERALT: Here. CEDRIC: Ah, thank you. The forest has been calmer since you killed the kayran, you know. GERALT: Glad to hear it. Now focus, Cedric. Roses of remembrance... Where can I find some? CEDRIC: Proceed south through the forest, all the way to the lake. Beware of the endregas and nekkers, and the traps that I've set. Nearby, on a plateau, you'll find the garden of Eldan and Cymoril... GERALT: Liquor will kill you, Cedric... You should drink less. CEDRIC: I prefer this fog to madness. Wouldn’t you? [Geralt goes to the elven ruins Cáelmewedd and retrieves a rose. He brings it back to Triss at the tavern.] GERALT: Triss... I found a rose of remembrance. TRISS: Hmmm... I bet it's beautiful there. GERALT: Might've been at one time. Now it's just plain sad. TRISS: I need time to devise the spell. It could take as much as a few days. GERALT: Mm-hmm. TRISS: What do you plan to do while you wait? GERALT: I'm going to meet Iorveth. TRISS: Well don't get yourself killed - that'd be pretty stupid now. GERALT: What're you getting at? TRISS: You're about to recover your memory, which will give you a whole new perspective on things. We'll learn what happened to Yennefer... GERALT: Uh-huh. And you expect me to drop everything and tell Roche, 'Hey, it's been great, but I've got places to go and people to find'? TRISS: You know you could. I-I mean, you don't really owe him anything. TRISS: I'm just afraid you'll get caught up in something and you won't be able to back out. Iorveth's a sly old elf, he's been fighting humans for a full century at least... This Letho is no common bandit either, and I shudder to think who put him on the warpath... It's a mire, Geralt, deep and hungry, and it could swallow you whole before you know it. GERALT: It possibly already has. TRISS: I want you to know that I'm prepared to travel to the end of the world with you to save Yennefer. I owe you that, I owe her that... I'm prepared to drop everything - the trappings of court life, politics, the regicides... I could even live at Kaer Morhen. It's up to you. GERALT: Triss... TRISS: Let me finish - I can only say this once: If you want to go alone, I'll understand... and I won't try to persuade you otherwise. I don't want to lose you. GERALT: I can't know what the future holds. I don't know what else is hidden in my mind. But whatever it is, whatever happens, I don’t want to lose you. I'd have to be an utter fool and complete ingrate to let you go. TRISS: That's kind, thank you... Does that mean we're leaving the regicides to Roche and tending to our own matters? I can't. GERALT: I really would like to go, but I need to clear my name. Foltest's men and bounty hunters of all kinds would never let it go. We'd be fugitives - and that's not a life I'd want for me or for you. GERALT: Besides, I'd feel as if I'd given up when there was still something to do. I'd feel like I fled. And as I see it, we haven't lost yet. TRISS: Whatever your decision, I want you to know you can count on me. I need a few days to prepare the spells. GERALT: I need to talk to Zoltan about Iorveth. It's not a closed conversation - we'll talk again, but only after I've settled things with the kingslayer. I guess so. GERALT: I think so... And I think you're right - I don't owe anyone anything. TRISS: I'm glad you've noticed that. GERALT: But that doesn't mean I'm willing to sit around doing nothing. You need time anyway, and in that time I'll catch the kingslayer. TRISS: Geralt, please be careful. GERALT: I'll go see Zoltan, and together we'll go find Iorveth. With a little luck, I'll capture the kingslayer, and then... we can go back to living our own lives. TRISS: Good. Will you talk to Roche? GERALT: I'll think about it... I'll catch the kingslayer before you finish your preparations. GERALT: If all goes well, I'll catch the kingslayer before you finish preparing the spells... TRISS: And if it doesn't go well? GERALT: Triss, do you really expect me to spend two days at the tavern drinking with the locals while Letho's out there taking control of a Scoia'tael unit...? TRISS: No. But what will you do? What if Iorveth scoffs at your news, what he says Letho's escaped and no one knows where to find him? Will we go? Will we leave the regicide to Roche and continue with our own lives? You know I can't. [Same as \"I can't\" above.] I guess so. [Same as \"I guess so.\" above.] I need to think this through. GERALT: I gotta give this some thought. TRISS: You've got time. A few days. GERALT: And I think best while doing. I'll meet with Iorveth. With a little luck, I should be able to capture the kingslayer before you've finished your preparations. TRISS: If you say so. GERALT: Once I've recovered my memory, we'll decide what to do. [If Geralt agrees to leave with Triss, he can go talk to Roche in the tavern to inform him.] GERALT: A few days from now, I plan to leave, get back on the Path, back to my witcher's work. That'll mean the end of our mission. ROCHE: Care to tell me what prompted this decision? GERALT: Triss - she knows how to restore my memory. ROCHE: Why not drop everything and leave now? GERALT: Triss needs time to prepare the spells. ROCHE: You're giving up... No other name for it - you're just giving up. What of the kingslayer? Many still believe you're him. GERALT: I don't think I care anymore. Those whose opinions I value, well, they know the truth. ROCHE: Uh-uh. You see someone kick a dog and you're incapable of letting it go. And you want to release that fiend who we've succeeded in cornering, who's thrashing to get out of the cage we’ve put up around him? GERALT: I want nothing of the sort. I'm not leaving for a few more days. In that time I'll catch Letho for you. That's the kingslayer's name, incidentally... I know how to get him. ROCHE: How? GERALT: You're not going to like this, but it'll involve working with the Scoia'tael... ROCHE: Is your mind completely ploughed at this point? Did Triss put this nonsense in your head? GERALT: Listen to me... You'll get your kingslayer soon. I'll give you him or his head. After which you'll clear me of all charges and let me go my way. ROCHE: What else? Perhaps you'd like me to embrace Iorveth in gratitude as well? GERALT: Iorveth's not my problem. I'm no elf hunter. I've never been one, and I don't intend to become one. ROCHE: Oh, enough... You've made your decision - I can see that. So be it... But I think we all know who's being the prick here. [This concludes the quest.] . [If Geralt asks Triss to accompany him, they go together to the waterfall.] TRISS: Ugh... I think we've arrived. The cascade, the menhir. We need to take the path leading upwards. GERALT: Gardens in the middle of forests... Those elves really liked to complicate things. TRISS: Stop whining. It's not far now. TRISS: Cedric told me a beautiful legend about this place. GERALT: Legends are almost always beautiful, especially elven ones. The reality often leaves a lot to be desired. TRISS: Well, Cedric also said the site itself was something wonderful. TRISS: The rose must be here somewhere. GERALT: I'll look around. TRISS: Eldan and Cymoril. Cedric said Cymoril eclipsed even Francesca Findabair with her beauty, and Francesca's reputed to be the world's most beautiful woman. GERALT: Cedric drinks too much. TRISS: He really has visions, you know. He really has the gift. He could learn to control it if he drank less... GERALT: Cedric drinks to get rid of the visions. And that's something I understand perfectly well. [Triss and Geralt come to Eldan and Cymoril's garden and stop in front of the statue of the two lovers.] TRISS: Oh my. Lovers... Look, Geralt, it's beautiful. GERALT: Mhm. TRISS: I just don't understand it. How did the elves become so cruel? The one with the scar had so much hatred in him. GERALT: Places like this make you realize just how much they've lost... There used to be entire elven cities, and the forests were theirs to enjoy, not to hide in. Humans destroyed that, put them in reservations. Iorveth and his kind are taking revenge, though not all elves are like that. TRISS: Ciaran said there's a lot more at stake... GERALT: He has his ideal, a certain vision of the world, but do you think there's room for humans in it? TRISS: We're practically one and the same. GERALT: Wrong, Triss. We've been learning from each other for generations, but we're different at base. TRISS: I don't know why I find that awfully sad. GERALT: Just like this garden. Beautiful and sad. [Geralt picks a flower.] GERALT: Triss... TRISS: Cymoril's rose of remembrance... Legend has it they wilt unless nourished with blood, and also if they're sold... But give it to someone you love, and it'll live forever. Here. GERALT: This one's for you. TRISS: Ohh, Geralt... GERALT: I want you to keep it. If there's any truth to the legend, it shouldn't wilt, even if you pluck a petal or two. TRISS: Thank you. That's not fair. GERALT: Well, this is awkward... TRISS: Oh, please, Geralt. It's just some stupid elven story. Give me the rose before you break it. GERALT: It's not stupid, it's just that... [A trio of bandits enter the garden.] BANDIT 1: This is the statue, Curly. BANDIT 1: Don't mind us. BANDIT 1: Imagine the coin we'll get. I won't leave the brothel for a month. BANDIT 2: Six weeks, even. BANDIT 1: Where does that woman get the gold for all this? I mean, her and the old man - they're buying a new house, and now these statues for the garden. Must be defrawing the treasury. What's a town chancellor do, anyway? BANDIT 2: It'll be ploughing hard to move. BANDIT 1: We'd never shift it in one piece. I know - we'll break off the legs, the heads, remove it in bits. TRISS: Break off your own head, clown! BANDIT 3: Shut your trap, cunt. [Geralt and Triss have to fight the bandits. As Geralt kills the last one, a fourth one appears from over the wall and ambushes Triss. Geralt leaps forward to save her, and both he and Triss end up falling through the ground into an elven bathhouse.] TRISS: Incredible what the Aen Seidhe built before human ships ever appeared in the Pontar Delta. Elves possess a sensitivity humans can't ever hope to acquire. TRISS: Looks like we're stuck. GERALT: Mhm. TRISS: There must be another way out of here. GERALT: Mhm. TRISS: Why're you looking at me that way? Do I have something on my face? GERALT: Nuh-uh. TRISS: What's going on in that head of yours, witcher? Nothing. Let's get out of here. GERALT: Nothing, sorry. We need to find another way out. TRISS: Are you all right, Geralt? GERALT: Yeah, I'm fine. We should look for that exit. GERALT: Any Scoia'tael scouts in the area heard the sounds of the fighting. They won't miss that hole we dropped through either... TRISS: And here I thought I was the cautious one... GERALT: Did you say something? TRISS: No, nothing. You could use a bath. GERALT: Oh, you know, stuff. You could use a bath. TRISS: So could you. [If Geralt chooses \"You could use a bath\": Triss and Geralt get intimate in the bath. Above them, Scoia'tael enter the garden and stop to examine the bandits' bodies. One is an elf, Hearvihen, and the other a dwarf, Zagen.] HEARVIHEN: A witcher's blade. Letho comes here to think... ZAGEN: Well, he's not here now, so we've no reason to stay. HEARVIHEN: The dh'oine stole the story of Eldan and Cymoril, as they now steal our roses of remembrance. A more silly and shallow tale I've never heard. An enchanted wood, a beautiful elven couple living within, a handsome, human prince arrives, riding a milk white stallion... Bloede dh'oine! HEARVIHEN: We Aen Seidhe remember how it was... Limitless devotion, passion, commitment... and sacrifice. Legend has it the lovers' sighs are enchanted within these very stones, though only those in love can hear them. [The Scoia'tael turn to leave.] ZAGEN: Singing bushes... jabbering stones... Elven hogwash. [pauses, hears the sound of Triss moaning] Well, I'm buggered. [Geralt and Triss get dressed.] TRISS: We should take walks more often. For a while there, I forgot all about Flotsam, the Scoia'tael, the kingslayer, the whole world, really... GERALT: Nice to know I still have that power... [Initiates the \"I need time to devise the spell.\" conversation. After Geralt has either agreed or disagreed with Triss, a muffled voice can be heard shouting.] ROCHE: Geralt! Geralt! [One of the walls crumbles, and Roche bursts through.] ROCHE: There you are. Is everything all right? ROCHE: This is nice... ROCHE: What a beautiful place. TRISS: Very... GERALT: How'd you find us? ROCHE: Finding those I seek is a speciality of mine. Now let's get out of here - the Scoia'tael are out in droves. GERALT: Wait, Vernon. We need to talk. ROCHE: About what? [If you didn't agree with Triss] GERALT: Actually, it can wait... ROCHE: Fine, then. Let's get out of here. [If you agreed with Triss] [Plays out the same as the tavern conversation.] . [Choosing \"Nothing. Let's get out of here\" initiates the \"I need time to devise the spell\" conversation. After Geralt either agrees or disagrees with triss, he breaks the wall with Aard, and he and Triss climb up to the surface. The trio of Scoia'tael have not left yet.] HEARVIHEN: A witcher's blade. Letho... He comes here to think. ZAGEN: I don't give a goat's balls what that rogue does for leisure. Can we go, or do you need to ponder some rocks? HEARVIHEN: Eldan and Cymoril. A beautiful story that humans turned into a shallow lie. Bloede dh'oine! ZAGEN: I know, I know... humans are scoundrels and pricks. You ready? HEARVIHEN: But we Aen Seidhe remember how it was, the limitless devotion, passion... and sacrifice. ZAGEN: Please stop, poetry irks me. HEARVIHEN: Legend has it the lovers' sighs are enchanted within these very stones, though only those in love can hear them. ZAGEN: Singing bushes... jabbering stones... Elven hogwash. [Geralt and Triss emerge.] HEARVIHEN: Dh'oine! GERALT: Caelm, Seidhe... We're not looking for a fight. ZAGEN: Hear that, Hearvihen? A few words of Elder and he thinks he can go. HEARVIHEN: This is elven land, dh'oine, upon which your kind dies. Let us leave in peace. GERALT: There's no need to fight. We'll leave your land in peace. ZAGEN: Unbelievable! Spits in your face and claims it's raining! HEARVIHEN: Shut up, Zagen. Speak, dh'oine: whose are those corpses? I don't like your tone. GERALT: I'm not explaining myself to you, elf. Stand and fight. HEARVIHEN: I was hoping you'd say that. [Results in a fight.] [PERSUASION] They came here to steal the statue. GERALT: They tried to take the statue. We persuaded them otherwise. [FAILURE] HEARVIHEN: You could've said they attacked you. ZAGEN: Or that it was a drunken brawl. HEARVIHEN: But a dh'oine killing other dh'oine to protect elven statues? Pff...! [SUCCESS] HEARVIHEN: Be that as it may... Why did you come here? GERALT: We wanted to see this place, nothing more. ZAGEN: Nothing worth stealing around here. HEARVIHEN: Now you've seen it, go! Before I have a change of heart. ZAGEN: You're setting 'em free, Hearvihen? HEARVIHEN: Go. [AXII] Thieves. I took care of them. GERALT: Petty robbers from the trading post. I took care of them. [FAILURE] HEARVIHEN: Your tricks will not save you, dh'oine. [SUCCESS] [Same as for Persuasion.] [INTIMIDATION] I've had enough killing for today. GERALT: I've had enough killing for today. [FAILURE] HEARVIHEN: Truly? You should not have come here. [SUCCESS] HEARVIHEN: Leave this place. We'll have no more bloodshed here. Show me what you got. [Results in a fight.] [The Scoia'tael either leave or are killed by Geralt and Triss.] GERALT: Fresh air. TRISS: I'm glad you asked me along - that was edifying. GERALT: Really? What did you you learn? TRISS: You know why Eldan and Cymoril resisted all and stayed together? GERALT: Why? TRISS: Because they're statues. Just statues... GERALT: Triss... [Once they leave the garden, if Geralt agreed with Triss, he can meet with Roche in the tavern and tell him about his decision to leave with Triss. This concludes the quest.] ",

    "content": "&lt; PREV CONTENTS NEXT &gt; [After retrieving a rose of remembrance, Geralt talks to Zoltan in the tavern.] GERALT: Zoltan, I need to ask you a favor. ZOLTAN: Shoot. GERALT: I heard you know the local Scoia'tael. ZOLTAN: You heard? Meaning some goat's arse in a helmet hollered it out in the market square? GERALT: I need some way to get to this Iorveth. [If the kayran isn't dead, Zoltan says one of these things] ZOLTAN: Perhaps I could help, but as long as this ploughing ban remains in force, I can't stick my beak outside Flotsam's gates. ZOLTAN: We can go just as soon as I finish this trinket for Síle. That megascope of hers - delicate as a maiden's confidence. One tiny flaw on the diamond, and - poof! - it's liable to crumble. Don't you worry. The Scoia'tael won't go anywhere. I'm sure you can find a way to be useful in the meantime. ZOLTAN: I've some minor details to fine tune. Don't hold it against me. If I don't finish, the rag's likely to tell Loredo I'm uncooperative, and I don't want that trouble again. [If the kayran is dead] ZOLTAN: You know... I don't want you thinkin' I'm all chummy with the Scoia'tael. And Iorveth detests me. Why would you want to see him, anyway? GERALT: He knows where the kingslayer is. ZOLTAN: Iorveth? And here I always thought him a common thug. All right, no reason to sit on our arses. Come on - you can tell me everythin' on the way. [Geralt follows Zoltan.] GERALT: Lead on, Zoltan. ZOLTAN: Tell me, who said I have contacts with the Scoia'tael? GERALT: Loredo. ZOLTAN: What a prick. GERALT: That's why he wanted to hang you - for making deals with the Squirrels? ZOLTAN: What?! I met a few, yes, but made no fucking deals. GERALT: What about their leader? ZOLTAN: They say Iorveth's mad, but the Scoia'tael are at his beck and call. Sod knows what he wants. GERALT: Hope he'll tell me what it is. ZOLTAN: Tell you what, of two evils, Loredo's the bigger prick. GERALT: Because he almost hanged you? ZOLTAN: Because he stirs up the locals against nonhumans. And there's word he's colluding with Kaedwen. GERALT: What's his angle? ZOLTAN: Greed. King Henselt would gladly annex more land and grant Loredo privileges. Come on, we've got a long way to go. ZOLTAN: We need to go deeper into the forest. I hope they didn't change the password. GERALT: You know their password? What're you playing at, Zoltan? ZOLTAN: All right... The Scoia'tael asked me to command a unit. GERALT: No wonder Loredo wanted you hanged. ZOLTAN: Ah, they may have asked, but I didn't accept their fucking offer! [They stop at a shrine in the forest.] ZOLTAN: This is it. I was due to meet them here. GERALT: I know. They're aiming arrows at us. ZOLTAN: What? Geralt, I know full well you're always vigilant, but quit poking fun at me. GERALT: Give them the password. ZOLTAN: What 'them'? GERALT: Hurry up. They're edgy. ZOLTAN: Kier-ke-gaard! [Two Scoia'tael approach.] ELE'YAS: Stop bawling. What do you want? ZOLTAN: Countersign. ELE'YAS: Hei-de-gger. I asked you a question. ZOLTAN: Take us to Iorveth. ELE'YAS: Why? GERALT: If we wanted to speak with you, we wouldn't ask for your leader. ELE'YAS: Iorveth won't talk with you. GERALT: You don't know that. ELE'YAS: Leave while you're still able. ZOLTAN: The two of you wont' scare us off. GERALT: There are four more in that tree. ELE'YAS: How do you know? GERALT: I can hear them breathing. One's sick or on fisstech. ELE'YAS: How...? GERALT: He's wheezing. ZOLTAN: What? You elven cocks gone soft? GERALT: We just want to talk to Iorveth. ELE'YAS: Wait at the clearing - the dwarf knows where. We'll let Iorveth know. ZOLTAN: Make sure you do. Come on, Geralt. ZOLTAN: I know what those elven pricks have planned. Been there once. GERALT: What are you talking about? ZOLTAN: That clearing is a monster's lair. Huge whoreson with a shell on its back. GERALT: An arachas in these parts? I thought that was impossible. ZOLTAN: I don't know the shit's name, but it's terrifying. They sent us into a trap. GERALT: Tough. Let's go. [They come to the ledge above the clearing where Iorveth fed a nekker to the arachas.] ZOLTAN: We're here. That creature prowls down there. GERALT: Right where we're supposed to meet Iorveth. ZOLTAN: Exactly! Any ideas? GERALT: [shrugs] I last fought an arachas some time ago. ZOLTAN: I never had the swiving pleasure. Not that I mind. GERALT: Wait here... ZOLTAN: What are you...? Think me a limp prick? [Geralt and Zoltan descend into the clearing. The arachas scuttles out of its lair.] ZOLTAN: This is the place the elves mentioned. GERALT: That thing approaching us is no elf. ZOLTAN: I'll leave it to you, Geralt. Monsters are not my speciality. [As soon as the arachas falls, Scoia'tael leap out of hiding, fixing bows on Zoltan and Geralt. Iorveth emerges.] IORVETH: A lovely show, Gwynbleidd. But tell me, was it worth it? An uneven fight, and certain death await you anyway. GERALT: I could ask you the same thing. IORVETH: What do you want, vatt'ghern? Speak quickly, before I kill you both. You're a murderer. GERALT: You're a bandit, Iorveth - a thief and murderer. No wonder the Commandant wants to get you. IORVETH: I am who I need to be. [He turns to go, and the Scoia'tael fire on Geralt and Zoltan.] Let Zoltan go. GERALT: Let Zoltan go, Iorveth. You have me. IORVETH: I have you both. A witcher, apparently seeking an ugly death... And a dwarven traitor, spitting on the honor of his folk. ZOLTAN: Know what I spit on, you divot? On you bloody squirts, riff-raff killing innocent men! IORVETH: Innocent men? So agitated when you shout that, it's even funny. Loredo was right about you. GERALT: Loredo was right. Peace is impossible as long as you live. IORVETH: Geralt of Rivia - the Commandant's bloodhound. In which case die, you pitiful little dh'oine. [The Scoia'tael kill Geralt and Zoltan.] I want Letho. GERALT: I want the kingslayer. Letho, the man whose crimes I'm accused of. IORVETH: If you hadn't become Foltest's lackey, you wouldn't have been there when he was murdered. Do you really expect me to betray a useful ally? As an apology for the assault at the riverbank. GERALT: You attacked us on the riverbank for no reason. You owe me. IORVETH: Not so. The only dh'oine I owe anything is Roche, but believe me, I shall pay that debt soon. Letho wants you dead. GERALT: Letho betrayed you. He wanted to make a deal with your comrade, Ciaran. IORVETH: Ciaran aep Easnillen is dead. Two weeks ago his warriors were ambushed and killed. You should invent better lies, Gwynbleidd. GERALT: He's on the barge. Wounded, but alive. He turned Letho down, and his unit paid the ultimate price. IORVETH: If you speak the truth, Letho will die. But words alone are not enough. Letho wants you dead. [Same as above.] What are you really fighting for? GERALT: What's your angle, Iorveth? IORVETH: You wouldn't understand. GERALT: Hiding in woods, killing berry-pickers, eating roots... IORVETH: We live by our own rules, doing what's necessary to attain our goal. You've lost everything. GERALT: So it's pride that keeps you sneaking around woods and sleeping in ditches? You've fallen low, Aen Seidhe. IORVETH: Watch your words, Gwynbleidd. What's at the end of your path? [Same as \"What is this goal?\"] You're a disgrace to your race. GERALT: Self-appointed heroes like you will doom your race. IORVETH: Perhaps. But you won't live to see it. Va fail, vatt'ghern. [The Scoia'tael kill Geralt and Zoltan.] What is this goal? GERALT: What is your goal? IORVETH: What's it to you, Geralt? Esseath vatt'ghern... You'd tell me to stuff it up my arse. GERALT: Not everything deserves that fate. My life now depends on your whim, so I'm curious. IORVETH: Then listen well. The two dead kings were whoresons who'd damn their own children to stay in power. But in the east there's someone truly deserving of a crown. What's your connection to the kingslayer? GERALT: So, the hired assassin turned out to be a traitor... IORVETH: It's his word against yours... GERALT: For now. Why do you trust him? Because he's a dh'oine who agreed to do shady work for you? IORVETH: He did what had to be done. He proved nobody's untouchable. There are nonhumans living in Flotsam. GERALT: You attack and murder the people of Flotsam, forgetting that elves and dwarves live among them. IORVETH: That's no life! They've been stripped of self-respect, forced to live and die by human laws. They're more dh'oine than you, Geralt. What will you do with Letho? GERALT: You still trust this assassin? IORVETH: You may be lying... GERALT: If I'm lying, so did Ciaran. IORVETH: We'll investigate it for his sake. We shall see how Letho reacts to your sensational news. GERALT: Where is he? IORVETH: The ruins of Cáelmewedd. For some reason he likes the place. My unit will cover us. Ready? GERALT: Why did you want Foltest dead? IORVETH: He might have appeared charming, but in reality he allowed the elder races in Temeria to be oppressed. He was like all dh'oine, but his death has more significance. Let's go. GERALT: We need to go. I need to do something first. GERALT: Let's meet there. I have something to take care of first. IORVETH: Va fail, Gwynbleidd. Just don't try any tricks... ZOLTAN: We came here together, we're leaving together. GERALT: No, Zoltan. Your presence might raise suspicions. ZOLTAN: As you wish. Just don't get slaughtered. ",

[Letho is sitting at the base of the statue when Geralt and Iorveth arrive.] LETHO: Geralt of Rivia... What's the meaning of this? GERALT: I'm here to negotiate. LETHO: Ah! Iorveth, the woodland fox, caught at last. I underestimated you. You'll answer for regicide. GERALT: You killed Foltest. You'll answer for that. LETHO: You're the only one who saw it happen. You'll do the answering. What's your connection to Iorveth? GERALT: I wondered what a human was doing among the Scoia'tael. LETHO: 'My enemy's enemy is my friend.' Know the saying? The Scoia'tael are my brothers in vengeance. Who are you? GERALT: Who are you? LETHO: You really don't remember? GERALT: I'm sick of that question. LETHO: So it's true. And here I feared that you'd ruin it all. I am Letho of Gulet. I'm a kingslayer. Who do you work for? GERALT: Tell me who you're working for and the elf is yours. LETHO: We work for ourselves. GERALT: We? LETHO: The kingslayers. Why are you killing kings? GERALT: Demavend, Foltest... Who else? Who the hell are you? LETHO: We've met, Geralt. Do you remember? GERALT: No... LETHO: I'll never forget it. You saved my life, White Wolf. We fought side by side, now we'll cross blades. This wouldn't be necessary if I'd killed Iorveth first. IORVETH: Serrit and Auckes will drown in their own blood. LETHO: Oh, I don't think so. My men will finish their task long before the Scoia'tael in the Pontar Valley realize you're dead. Who are Serrit and Auckes? GERALT: Serrit and Auckes - who are they? IORVETH: Kingslayers the Scoia'tael are assisting in the Pontar Valley, in Upper Aedirn. I've spoken to Ciaran. GERALT: Ciaran aep Easnillen told me you want to eliminate Iorveth. LETHO: Even if I do, why would you help me? IORVETH: Bloede dh'oine. Draw your sword. GERALT: I don't see any other way to do this... Draw your sword. We don't have to fight. GERALT: This doesn't need to end in blood. Tell me everything. IORVETH: Enough of this farce! Vedrai! Enn'le! [Scoia'tael leap out.] LETHO: What game are you playing? GERALT: One that you just lost. [A Scoia'tael falls to a crossbow bolt. Roche and the Blue Stripes join the fray.] IORVETH: Give me my sword. [Help Roche.] [Geralt punches Iorveth in the face, knocking him out.] [Give Iorveth his sword]. [Geralt throws Iorveth his weapon.] IORVETH: Die... [Iorveth clashes with Roche.] ROCHE: Get the kingslayer! LETHO: I have to kill you. GERALT: Try it. But I'm no king. [Geralt and Letho tumble into the bathhouse below.] LETHO: Such a pity we're on opposite sides. LETHO: I see you still know how to fight. LETHO: Why do you hound me? GERALT: They think I killed Foltest! LETHO: It's your own fault for playing soldier boy. GERALT: Why would a witcher kill kings? LETHO: I'm a witcher no more. That was long ago. GERALT: So you're a hired thug now? Congratulations! GERALT: Should've surrendered when you could. LETHO: You fight well, but you were better once. GERALT: The muscles remember. LETHO: One thing the Wild Hunt couldn't take from you. GERALT: A witcher and a few elves are enough to kill a king? [Letho's Aard sends Geralt flying across the room, sword knocked from his hand. Letho picks it up.] LETHO: You've no idea how many people were eager to help us. GERALT: You really think they will all keep quiet? LETHO: Iorveth's time is running out. The others will be judged and condemned for sowing chaos. GERALT: So why...? LETHO: You were one of us, Geralt. You saved us. Now we're even. LETHO: Your witch is good with magic. Think she'll be able to teleport me to Aedirn? If she behaves, I won't harm her... GERALT: I'll find you. LETHO: See you in Aedirn, then. [Letho drops Geralt's sword and leaves.] [If Geralt helped Iorveth] [Iorveth arrives after Letho is gone.] GERALT: Where's Roche? IORVETH: We killed a few of his men, the rest ran. Is Letho dead? GERALT: On his way to Flotsam. IORVETH: How do you know? GERALT: He wants to find Triss. IORVETH: Kill him. Before he contacts the others. GERALT: You shouldn't have trusted a dh'oine. Let's go. IORVETH: We can't go there, Geralt. The garrison. GERALT: Of course... I forgot what kind of warriors you are. IORVETH: Maethe taerde, Gwynbleidd. Good luck. [If Geralt helped Roche] [Roche arrives after Letho is gone.] ROCHE: What happened?! Where is he? Where's the kingslayer? GERALT: Fled. Iorveth? ROCHE: Captured. My men have taken him to Flotsam. The kingslayer may attempt to spring him from prison. GERALT: I doubt it. He needs Triss. ROCHE: Really? Why? GERALT: I've set the elves against him so he can't move through the forests. I have to find Triss first. ROCHE: Follow me, then. ROCHE: We've got Iorveth. That changes everything! ",

GUARD: Sorry, I can't. My orders were simple: don't let the witcher in. Who gave that order? GERALT: Who gave that order? GUARD: Commandant Loredo. I can't let you in... It's dangerous inside. GERALT: A close friend is in mortal danger... You wouldn't want me to blame you for a tragedy? GUARD: Won't put that one by me, witcher. [BRIBE] I found a coin pouch... GERALT: I found this coin pouch near the gate... You happen to lose it? [FAILURE] GUARD: Won't put that one by me, witcher. [SUCCESS] GUARD: Might have. I like your honesty - don't see that too often these days. And providin' for my children's more difficult - buy 'em this, buy 'em that. A worthy pouch. Unlike those Loredo gives us. [AXII] Come on. Let me in - nobody'll know. GERALT: Who'd be bothered by a witcher within the town walls? [FAILURE] GUARD: Won't put that one by me, witcher. [SUCCESS] GUARD: Right... Come in, White One. [Geralt enters to find Flotsam in flames. Humans are mobbing nonhumans in the streets.] RIOTER: We were too good to you! Fattened yourselves on our toil! DWARF: Have mercy! [Geralt interrupts.] RIOTER 1: Look lads, another... freak. RIOTER 2: Whaddaya want? Go to your homes. GERALT: Disperse, go home. Now. RIOTER 1: Uhhhh... What?! You're not in charge here, freak! RIOTER 2: Grab a pitchfork! [Geralt is forced to fight.] Let's see how you do against me. GERALT: You want blood? RIOTER 1: That's our business. Piss off. GERALT: You should've stayed home, you bastards. RIOTER 2: Get the freak! Kill him! [Geralt is forced to fight.] [AXII] He didn't do anything to you. Leave him alone. GERALT: Leave the dwarf alone. He's done you no harm. [FAILURE] [Same as \"Disperse, go home. Now.\"] [SUCCESS] RIOTER 1: Right, he's our... neighbor. RIOTER 2: We best go home, folks.... DWARF: Thanks, witcher. If not for you, I'd be a dead dwarf. GERALT: Hide. The humans have gone mad. [Geralt overhears a ruckus from the tavern.] DANDELION: You're killing innocents! INNKEEPER: Innocents? Who was it slaughtered our lads in the forest?! Stinking nonhumans! Begone, shitty fiddler, or we'll slit your throat, too! ELF WOMAN: We didn't kill those humans in the forest. INNKEEPER: Iorveth's dogs! Elves did! You murdered my son, you bastards! GERALT: He needs help. [Geralt enters the tavern to find Dandelion standing between the innkeeper and some rioters and a pair of elf women.] DANDELION: Geralt! DANDELION: And now, good people, return to your homes before you taste a witcher's blade... DANDELION: So what'll it be, innkeeper? INNKEEPER: They killed my son! Damned elves! I want their blood for that! These elves are innocent. GERALT: Your son fought the Scoia'tael. They killed him. INNKEEPER: It's one and the same! Elves are elves! I won't let you kill them. GERALT: I won't let you harm them. INNKEEPER: You don't scare us! Kill the vagrants! [Geralt is forced to fight.] [INTIMIDATION] Calm down... GERALT: You'd best calm down if you want to live to sire another son. What do you say? [FAILURE] INNKEEPER: You don't scare us! Kill the vagrants! [Geralt is forced to fight.] [SUCCESS] INNKEEPER: You'll meet your match one day, freak. RIOTER: Consider yourselves lucky, elven scum! But one day... Eh, come on, folks. [AXII] These aren't the elves who killed your son... GERALT: These elves had nothing to do with your son's death. Don't shed their blood. INNKEEPER: Now that you mention it... Yeah, leave them be. Go home, folks! ELF WOMAN 1: Thank you, Gwynbleidd. We'd be dead if not for you. ELF WOMAN 2: The sooner we flee, the better... GERALT: Take care. DANDELION: Phew, that was close. GERALT: Who opened the gates of hell? DANDELION: I don't have any proof, but my coin's on Loredo. Rulers are always looking for a way to cover their mistakes and failures. And the mob always loves a circus, whether merry or bloody. This town will never be the same. A time of disdain has come. How did it start? GERALT: How did the rioting start? DANDELION: They say it's revenge for those soldiers who died following Roche. But they were just thugs on Loredo's pay. Almost no one misses them. 'Spontaneous' riot, my ass... Loredo's staying out of it, keeping his hands clean, but his thugs are inciting the mob. I've seen several soldiers in civilian garb leading it. But you won't find any proof against the Commandant. GERALT: I don't intend to. Why is the garrison idle? GERALT: Why don't the guards do anything? DANDELION: Why would they? The Squirrels slaughtered their cronies and Loredo hasn't given them any orders. Have you seen Triss? GERALT: We need to find Triss. DANDELION: Last I saw her, she was on her way to meet Síle in her rented quarters at the inn. I told Triss about the megascope Zoltan's been building. Let's find Triss. GERALT: Let's go, there's no time to lose. DANDELION: I was lucky enough to get the key to Síle's nest... Incidentally, for a big woman, the innkeeper's wife is surprisingly nimble... [Outside, Geralt interrupts another mob of humans attacking a trio of dwarves.] DWARF: Help! GERALT: I've walked into a slaughterhouse... RIOTER 1: What sort of freak is that? RIOTER 2: It's that sorcerer! Go home. GERALT: Go to your homes, now. RIOTER 2: Or what? You'll enchant us all? RIOTER 1: Get the nonhuman! [Geralt is forced to fight.] Come here, you pigs. GERALT: Want some nonhuman blood? RIOTER 1: Ah, defendin' traitors, are we? RIOTER 2: Grab him! Come on lads, slaughter him with the others! [Geralt fights the rioters.] [AXII] Leave them in peace... GERALT: Leave them alone. They've done you no harm. [FAILURE] [Same as \"Go to your homes, now.\"] [SUCCESS] RIOTER 1: Right, they're our neighbors. RIOTER 2: Let's go home lads.... DWARF: Thank you. I just about felt the blade's chill between my ribs... We've done them no harm... Why are they so...? GERALT: Mobs always need a scapegoat after a defeat. Take care of yourselves, the trading post's still boiling. [Outside Síle's room is a smear of blood.] GERALT: Blood... I've got a bad feeling about this. [Geralt and Dandelion go in to find Síle's room trashed and her megascope destroyed.] DANDELION: Not good... GERALT: Don't just stand there. We need to look for clues. [The body of Síle's bodyguard lies in the corner.] GERALT: Síle's bodyguard... His neck's broken, no wounds. So, that's not his blood. DANDELION: Triss enters, breaks the guard's neck, then wounds herself...? That's stupid. GERALT: What a mess. Someone had a good time in here. Trashed everything... DANDELION: I don't get it. Someone else had to be here... [Geralt examines the wall of Síle's room.] GERALT: Dandelion, look! DANDELION: What is it? GERALT: A peephole. Someone might've been spying... DANDELION: The brothel's behind that wall. Maybe the madame saw what happened? GERALT: Let's go. [Dandelion and Geralt run into the brothel to find Margot curled up next to the bed beside the body of one of her girls.] MARGOT: Come back later, we're closed... They've killed one of my girls... DANDELION: It's Derae, Geralt. That was her room. GERALT: What happened? MARGOT: They murdered her. Yesterday they loved her, drank wine with her, told her she's pretty... Today, five of them came, drunk on blood, screaming filth. GERALT: She had a client at the time? MARGOT: No, she was with me. What're you looking at? I was consoling her... GERALT: I was hoping you knew what happened in the next room. I noticed a peephole, but if you were busy... MARGOT: We were, until we heard voices beyond the wall. Síle normally cast spells that blocked both sight and sound, but there was nothing like that this time. MARGOT: We started peeping - me first. I saw that redhead, Triss Merigold, and Cedric, our drunkard ex-Squirrel. The redhead approached the magic mirror and said, 'Let's see who our ice queen's been talking to recently.' DANDELION: She meant Síle. MARGOT: Even I figured that out. She waved her hands, shouted an incantation, and a man appeared in the room. Mighty ugly - Derae was so scared she squealed. When I finally got Derae out of the way, a different figure was in the room. A woman Triss called 'Philippa.' [A flashback to Derae and Margot peeping. On the other side of the wall, Triss converses with a sorceress.] TRISS: Greetings, Philippa. PHILIPPA: Triss... You're looking nice. Why are you using Síle's megascope? I can't believe she approved it. That's like using her toothbrush. TRISS: Síle's oblivious to it. What did Síle want from you? TRISS: What did Síle want from you? PHILIPPA: Isn't it obvious? Two Northern rulers have perished. We've been thinking on these developments. TRISS: Temeria is in chaos and I lost my position. There goes the effort we put into building peace! What's your intention? What has the Lodge decided? I mean, it was created to protect the interests of magic. PHILIPPA: We'll adjust to the new order and make use of this situation. TRISS: Five years of my work wasted! The Peace of Cintra hangs by a thread and Temeria will plunge into civil war any day now! There's nothing to use! We need to find those responsible and dispense justice! PHILIPPA: Calm down. Two things should be partaken cold - sorrel soup and politics. Calculate and don't let your emotions lead you. We can't resurrect Foltest, so stop playing the avenger. We'll proceed wisely and deliberately. We'll use the situation. Understand? TRISS: At least help me clear the witcher's name. PHILIPPA: Triss, stop thinking with your vagina and get a hold of yourself. The witcher will manage... The girl from Aedirn... TRISS: Do you think the girl... PHILIPPA: Saskia the Dragonslayer! Legend has it she killed a dragon! TRISS: Can she oppose Henselt's might? PHILIPPA: It won't be easy, but she's already accomplished miracles. TRISS: So war is inevitable? PHILIPPA: Henselt can't be reasoned with. What's Síle doing in Flotsam? TRISS: Why did Síle come to Flotsam? PHILIPPA: It's a delicate matter. We need someone at Henselt's court, but he hates sorceresses... TRISS: I know. PHILIPPA: Henselt's only son died in a hunting accident three years ago. The king has failed to sire more offspring, in spite of trying incessantly. Síle claims she can heal the king's faulty 'apparatus,' but needs very rare ingredients. TRISS: Which she intends to harvest from the kayran. PHILIPPA: Exactly. This way a sorceress will have the king's ear again. Where are you, now? TRISS: I heard you left Redania. PHILIPPA: I intend to stop Aedirn from falling apart. There's a popular uprising here, a real fight for freedom. You'd like it... TRISS: I doubt it. PHILIPPA: It had started before Demavend's death. The rebels are led by a girl - both beautiful and smart. She's achieved the impossible - humans and nonhumans, nobles, burghers and peasants, marching side by side towards a new beginning... PHILIPPA: They gave the royalists a heavy thrashing. Now they're the only armed force in Aedirn. TRISS: What happened to Demavend's son, Prince Stennis? PHILIPPA: He's joined the rebellion and makes a virtue of necessity. He pretends to like the idea of equality and justice. TRISS: What's your intention? PHILIPPA: To stop Henselt of Kaedwen conquering Upper Aedirn. Our bellicose king would become too powerful. That's for a start. Then I'll need to ensure the right individual ascends to the Aedirnian throne. [Flashback ends.] MARGOT: That's all I know, really... Dandelion, who's Philippa? GERALT: Dandelion, who's Philippa? Do you know her? DANDELION: Philippa Eilhart - a sorceress counselor to King Radovid of Redania. She's a grand mistress of the world's most fetid cuisine - politics. DANDELION: She's amoral in a crystalline way, so devoid of conscience that she's a phenomenon. Rumor is she's out of favor at the Redanian court, which, if true, she probably arranged herself in order to leave the capital. What happened to Triss? GERALT: What happened to Triss? MARGOT: I don't know. I already told you about the only conversation I heard... just before those murderers came. They kicked me and stabbed Derae. But I heard fighting from the other room - the sorceress was screaming. MARGOT: When the murderers left, searching for other victims, I peered outside. Thought I saw Cedric sneaking through the alleys, towards the forest. He was staggering. GERALT: Thank you, Margot. I owe you. MARGOT: Witcher, wait. Give this to Iorveth. GERALT: A letter? MARGOT: The names of Derae's killers. He'll understand. You're spying for Iorveth? GERALT: You're spying for Iorveth? MARGOT: I help him from time to time. Just give him the letter. GERALT: I'll try, but I can't promise anything. I don't want to be party to murder. GERALT: I'd rather not get involved... MARGOT: Those bastards deserve punishment. GERALT: True. But I won't be party to another murder. MARGOT: Will you turn me in? GERALT: No. You've got nothing to worry about. I don't intend to see Iorveth. GERALT: I'm not going to meet Iorveth. MARGOT: Will you turn me in? GERALT: No. Don't worry. GERALT: Dandelion, wait here for me. I'm going to find Cedric. [Paths converge at Cedric's death.] ",

[Geralt and Dandelion go into the brothel and talk to the sex worker inside.] DERAE: Welcome, Dandelion. You're in luck - freebies today. But you still have to pay for a tag-team. DANDELION: Derae, this is Witcher Geralt. We just want to talk... GERALT: Tell us who used this room most recently. DERAE: Margot and me. GERALT: Margot? DANDELION: The madame... DERAE: What is it you want? GERALT: Triss Merigold, redheaded sorceress - she was in the next room... Do you know what happened to her? DERAE: W-we weren't spying. I know nothing... GERALT: There's no need to be scared. Just tell us what you saw. I know you looked through the peephole. DERAE: Margot was nervous about the holiday, she told the girls to give freebies today. Then she took me to me room and we made love. Just as I was, I was, well.... Well, we heard voices and Margot started spying. It was the sorceress and Cedric. DANDELION: Are you sure? DERAE: Yes. We started fighting for the peephole, but finally Margot let me take a peek. Triss said she was going to see who the 'ice queen' had spoken to recently. She approached the mirror and whispered something. There was a flash, and a terrible looking man popped out of the mirror. DANDELION: What did he look like? DERAE: Like a wyrm. A hungry, old wyrm. DANDELION: Huh. I wonder... DERAE: Triss was aghast, and the wyrm said, \"Why so pale, Merigold? Have you seen a ghost?\" Then he smiled maliciously, and... [A flashback to Derae and Margot peeping. On the other side of the wall, Triss converses with a sorcerer.] DETHMOLD: Why so pale, Merigold? Seen a ghost? What is it now? TRISS: Greetings, Dethmold. I wondered who Síle had been talking to, recently... DETHMOLD: Spying on each other, eh? That's new. What's your business? You spoke to Síle. TRISS: What did Síle want from you? DETHMOLD: Why would I tell you? TRISS: Because you hate her and only dislike me. You wouldn't miss the tiniest chance to make her life miserable. DETHMOLD: Ah-heh. You're right. Síle wants to unsaddle me - to take my place at Henselt's side. TRISS: Henselt hates sorceresses. DETHMOLD: Henselt lost his son and is having problems siring an heir. He's no longer a young man. She promised him offspring. Said she'd guarantee a child if he finds a young, strong woman. He'd just need to... TRISS: I know where children come from. DETHMOLD: Prove she's lying and I'll be most appreciative. TRISS: I can't, which means you've got a problem. DETHMOLD: Slow down. I still play first fiddle, you know. Know anything about the kingslayer? TRISS: I'm pursuing the kingslayer. Maybe you've heard something... DETHMOLD: Oooh, that gives me the chills... Whoever he is, he's done for. TRISS: You'll change your mind when the kingslayer nails your ruler. DETHMOLD: Merigold, think as befits a mage, because right now you bring shame to all sorcerers. Foltest is dead. It's your fault and, as rumor has it, your witcher lover's, too. TRISS: You don't believe that. DETHMOLD: What I believe matters little - the rumors do. You and your witcher are finished in Temeria. Unless you catch the culprit. What does Henselt intend? TRISS: What's Henselt up to? DETHMOLD: Are you out of your mind, Merigold?! Be glad I'm even talking to you. TRISS: I need to know what's going on. Help me, Dethmold, and I'll return the favor. DETHMOLD: You know nothing useful to me. And I don't want your graces - you don't tickle my fancy. [INTIMIDATION] We'll meet in person one day... TRISS: We'll meet one day when you won't have a king to hide behind. DETHMOLD: I wait eagerly, Merigold. And I can assure you, I won't be hiding. [Continues same as \"I have some information about Philippa.\"] [PERSUASION] I have some information about Philippa. Interested? TRISS: You've heard that Philippa has left Redania? DETHMOLD: Yes... Do you know where she is? TRISS: I do. But first you'll answer my question. DETHMOLD: Fine. A single question in exchange for information on Philippa. What do you know about the assassinations? TRISS: Do you know anything about the regicides? No lying. DETHMOLD: Oh, a mistake, Merigold. I really know nothing. All I can tell you is that it's not of Henselt's doing. I'll let you know if I discover anything. Your turn. What's Henselt up to? TRISS: What are Henselt's political plans? DETHMOLD: Ha, you're insolent, Merigold, but I gave you my word. Henselt wants to wrestle the Pontar Valley from Aedirn. And to force that weed Stennis to swear fealty. TRISS: Prince Stennis, Demavend's heir? DETHMOLD: The same. Aedirn bereft of the Pontar Valley will become a principality dependant on Kaedwen. Your turn. What does Síle want in exchange for the cure? TRISS: What does Síle want? What's her price for that miraculous cure? DETHMOLD: A seat on the royal council and the title to three alchemical shops which give above three hundred pounds in yearly revenue. TRISS: Well, well... DETHMOLD: If I had a say in this, I'd set the dogs on her. Your turn, Merigold. TRISS: Philippa's in Vergen - a small town near the Kaedweni-Aedirnian border. DETHMOLD: I know its location very well. The remnants of Aedirn's army have assembled there, led by a lass said to have killed a dragon. TRISS: Who's the girl? DETHMOLD: She commands a rabble of peasants, poor noblemen and nonhumans. Even Prince Stennis, Demavend's son, can't disregard her. But that's of no consequence. Henselt will trample those vermin, and chase them off with whips. What's Philippa doing there? TRISS: Telling you won't pay off, Dethmold. You know too little. Farewell. [The flashback ends.] DERAE: That's all. I didn't hear or see anything else. Have you ever spied on Síle? DERAE: I tried, but she always cast a spell and I couldn't hear or see a thing. GERALT: Every time? DERAE: She forgot once. But she just sat before those mirrors and whispered, 'Where are you? Where?' That's all. Who's Philippa? GERALT: Dandelion, who's Philippa? Do you know her? DANDELION: Philippa Eilhart - a sorceress counselor to King Radovid of Redania. She's a grand mistress of the world's most fetid cuisine - politics. DANDELION: She's amoral in a crystalline way, so devoid of conscience that she's a phenomenon. Rumor is she's out of favor at the Redanian court, which, if true, she probably arranged herself in order to leave the capital. Dandelion, what do you make of it? GERALT: Dandelion, this is confusing. What do you make of it? DANDELION: Later, witcher. We need to find Triss. What happened to Triss? GERALT: What happened to Triss and Cedric? DERAE: I've no idea, Margot pushed me away to get a peek herself. But I heard a smash, shouting and a fight. Margot covered the peephole with a picture. She was pale and told me to keep my mouth shut. DERAE: We sat for a while and left only when all was quiet. Margot went to her room and I haven't seen her since. But I noticed Cedric staggering away down the alley that leads towards the forest. GERALT: Dandelion, wait here. I'm going to find Cedric. DANDELION: What about Margot? GERALT: Right, we should look for her first. ",

[Geralt continues along Cedric's trail.] GERALT: He's bleeding heavily. I need to find him quick. GERALT: He's slowed down, getting weaker. He can't be far. [Geralt finds Cedric at the waterfall pool.] CEDRIC: Caedmill, Gwynbleidd... I no longer feel the pain... Always wanted to die among trees... GERALT: Cedric, what happened? CEDRIC: Triss asked me for help. I killed the dh'oine guarding the door, and we broke in. Again, I killed a dh'oine... GERALT: I know... Where's Triss? CEDRIC: A witcher came in. Attacked us. I tried to protect Triss... He was fast... too fast for me. He hit Triss before she could cast a spell... He knew how to fight a sorceress... Then he ordered her to activate the megascope... He needed to get to Aedirn... Near the dwarven town of Vergen. CEDRIC: Triss said it was madness, that she didn't have the coordinates... He gave her a strange look, threatening, 'Better give it your best, you're going first, with me right behind you.' Then I passed out. When I woke... they were gone. I knew I was dying. The forest called me. GERALT: Why, Cedric? Why did you get involved? CEDRIC: Why did you? Sometimes we must... Have I told you about my visions? That's why I drink. It helps. I'm safe in a mist of vodka... see nothing, feel nothing... GERALT: Cedric, calm down. CEDRIC: But now I see clearly. You need to regain your memory... Only then will you understand who's killing crowned dh'oine... and why. GERALT: How can I get it back? CEDRIC: In Aedirn... In a place tainted with dark magic... Where ghosts of the fallen will fight a great battle. Save their souls and your memory will return... CEDRIC: Wha-What's happening...? The forest... I feel a presence... GERALT: They come to bid you farewell. CEDRIC: My forest... Va fail, Gwynbleidd. Farewell. [Geralt closes Cedric's eyes and bows his head. Not long after, Dandelion and Zoltan arrive.] DANDELION: Geralt! Where have you been!? GERALT: The kingslayer, dammit. I almost had him. ZOLTAN: He fled? GERALT: Teleported to Aedirn. DANDELION: What?! How? GERALT: He forced Triss to cast the spell. ZOLTAN: Shit! DANDELION: Roche sent me to find you - we're setting off. He's learned something new. ZOLTAN: The Scoia'tael are also up to something big. What does Roche intend to do? GERALT: What's Roche planning? DANDELION: He went off on Loredo, so it must concern the commandant. It's something important. What do the Scoia'tael want to do? [If Geralt knocked Iorveth out] GERALT: What do you know about the Scoia'tael, Zoltan? ZOLTAN: They want to free Iorveth and the other prisoners. Your help will be crucial. [If Geralt threw Iorveth his sword] GERALT: What are the Scoia'tael planning? ZOLTAN: They want to storm the barge and they need your help! GERALT: When did you join the Scoia'tael, Zoltan? ZOLTAN: It's not like that. They're taking the prisoners to Drakenborg. A special prison for nonhumans. Bloody monument to human hatred! The Scoia'tael don't trust you, nor me for that matter. But you can change that. I guess I need to talk to them both. GERALT: I'll talk to them. Maybe Roche or the Scoia'tael can finally be useful. ",

ROCHE: What the fuck were you doing with the Scoia'tael? You gave Iorveth a sword! GERALT: You followed me? ROCHE: I've got others who do that for me, Geralt. Ves, to be exact. You don't trust me. GERALT: Iorveth and Letho had a falling out. I wanted to take advantage. ROCHE: Who's Letho? GERALT: The kingslayer. ROCHE: Ah, you're sworn friends now? GERALT: Stop pissing me off! I tried everything I could to get him! If you'd trusted me, we could've captured him by now. Iorveth can help us. GERALT: Iorveth knows a lot about the kingslayer, and they no longer see eye to eye. He could lead us to him. ROCHE: The only journey I'll make with Iorveth in tow is to the scaffold in Vizima's marketplace. GERALT: The kingslayer fled to Vergen in Aedirn. He forced Triss to teleport them both. ROCHE: Damn, he's made a mockery of us! If that's how he wants to play, I'll make him regret it. What sparked the massacre? GERALT: Flotsam's ablaze. How did it start? ROCHE: When Ves reported you'd met with Iorveth, I ordered Loredo to provide us with backup. The incompetent oafs were supposed to wait for a signal, but the crossbowmen were twitchy. ROCHE: We surprised them, but Iorveth... the Scoia'tael gave us hell. We barely escaped alive. Many of my men are wounded, but Loredo's people... When news that elves massacred a dozen soldiers hit the trading post, two of the soldiers' fathers decided to take it out on an elven girl. ROCHE: You can imagine what happened next. Dandelion said you learned something new. GERALT: I heard you have news for me. ROCHE: Loredo has a deal with Kaedwen. That merchant living in his house is Henselt's agent. For a pouch of gold the good commandant promised to support Kaedweni troops in the event of a conflict... GERALT: So, what now? ROCHE: I want that spy, to squeeze him for information. And I've sentenced Commandant Loredo to death. GERALT: Roche, we have to sail, we need to get to Aedirn. ROCHE: I'm not leaving until I deal with Loredo. The spy may know something about the kingslayers. I wouldn't be surprised if Henselt of Kaedwen was behind all this. All right, let's do it your way. GERALT: All right, let's deal with this spy. I need to do something. GERALT: I'll be back later. ROCHE: Dammit Geralt, it's not a date. You can't keep putting it off! [Agreeing leads to Death to the Traitor.] . [Geralt meets Zoltan and Iorveth in the elven ruins.] SCOIA'TAEL: Iorveth awaits you, dh'oine. ZOLTAN: Be sure to speak to Iorveth, Geralt. IORVETH: Where is he? GERALT: He forced Triss to teleport them both to Aedirn. IORVETH: No... The Scoia'tael in Aedirn will pay for my stupidity with their lives. IORVETH: Ele'yas, ready the unit to march. You'll leave immediately. There was a massacre in town. GERALT: There was a massacre in Flotsam. The streets run red with your brethren's blood. IORVETH: I know. That's why I need your help. GERALT: You want me to murder humans at your side? IORVETH: I wish death upon every one of those dh'oine. But that's not the point. Upper Aedirn is our goal. What's so important in Upper Aedirn? GERALT: Why Upper Aedirn? IORVETH: The Pontar Valley is a juicy piece of meat beset by hounds. GERALT: The Scoia'tael bite hardest. IORVETH: It's our land! Our forefathers' land. I'm no bandit, Gwynbleidd - I lead a great army. Looking to create an elven state? GERALT: It sounds like you want to establish an elven state. IORVETH: There is already an elven state - Dol Blathanna. GERALT: Francesca Findabair rules there. IORVETH: Rules? She merely carries out Nilfgaardian orders. We want a truly free state where an elf could visit a human inn! A land where humans could enter the forest without fear! You want to be king? GERALT: And you plan to be king? King Iorveth I? IORVETH: I've already told you, I know the head the crown would fit. We merely have to place it there. GERALT: Whose head is it? IORVETH: One who believes in integrity, honesty and honor. A person who won't sell out to Nilfgaard for a few florins. A woman named Saskia. GERALT: Is she your fiancée? IORVETH: Don't mock me, Gwynbleidd. GERALT: It sounds like she's more important to you. Not just a woman whose head would fit the crown. IORVETH: You'll understand once you meet her. Soon, the whole world will hear of the Virgin of Aedirn, a woman blessed with extraordinary courage. GERALT: Has she proven her courage, or is that just talk? IORVETH: She defeated a dragon. What do you know about Vergen? GERALT: You said you're going to Vergen. IORVETH: True. GERALT: Why go to a dwarven town? IORVETH: Henselt and his army have pitched camp on the right riverbank. The Virgin and a sorceress gather reinforcements to defend Aedirn. GERALT: Which sorceress? IORVETH: Philippa Eilhart. GERALT: What's a Redanian sorceress doing in Aedirn? IORVETH: Only she can reveal that. What's your plan? GERALT: What does the leader of an army expect of me? IORVETH: That you accompany me to Aedirn. Perhaps you'll find your sorceress there. You'll certainly find someone who will soon change the balance of power in the North. That's two days away on foot. GERALT: That's two days' travel on foot. You'll never make it in time. IORVETH: I have a plan. GERALT: What plan? IORVETH: First you must agree to help us. Count me in. GERALT: Count me in. We'll get Letho together. IORVETH: Excellent. We've no time to lose. We need to capture the prison barge. GERALT: You want to enter a town where they're massacring elves? GERALT: I take back what I said - you're not grandiose, you're mad. IORVETH: My mother claimed likewise. What's it all about, Iorveth? GERALT: I need to know more before I decide. IORVETH: No, vatt'ghern. You helped me with Letho. That's the sole reason we're speaking. We may both be pursuing the same son of a bitch, but I haven't forgotten the company you arrived in. IORVETH: Make your choice now. I'll let you go if you refuse. I couldn't do that later. I need to do something first. GERALT: I can help, but I need to take care of something first.

IORVETH: We jumped overboard but got there too late. Dandelion ran about, calling for help. Even tried to enter the tower, but he was badly burned.. While those human monsters stood and looked on in silence. GERALT: How's Dandelion? IORVETH: He's below deck. Ran out of the tower in flames and jumped in the river. We fished him out. Sooner or later, humans will kill off all the Aen Seidhe, all dwarves and gnomes. Then they'll start murdering one another. Your kind knows no other way, it's in your genes. You'll keep killing each other until only one remains, the strongest among you. A thousand years from now, a dim-witted human barbarian will climb to the top of a pile of bones, sit down, and proclaim, \"I win!\" Did you see Roche? GERALT: Did Vernon Roche sail out of here all right? IORVETH: He's fine, if that's what you ask. We met and chatted - imagine that. I wanted him to know that he was only leaving because I let him do so. [Flashback to Iorveth and Roche's confrontation in the forest. The two circle each other, then engage in single combat.] [If Iorveth wins] IORVETH: The Temerian Special Forces, created by Foltest to combat the Scoia'tael after the first war with Nilfgaard. Veterans, professionals, the best of the best. This is the end, Roche. See these emblems? Temerian lilies - that's all I lacked. I've defeated the commanders of all the special forces in the North. Now, I shall unite the Scoia'tael... ROCHE: Finish what you started... IORVETH: I shan't kill you, Roche. We Aen Seidhe never kill the last specimens of dying breeds. Live on and remember who defeated you, remember he can do so again. Va fail, Vernon Roche. ROCHE: You're making a mistake, Iorveth. I will find you. [If Roche wins] IORVETH: Defeated by a dh'oine. I must be getting old... What now? ROCHE: Consider yourself lucky. Though you deserve torture, I lack the means, so I'll simply lop off your head. You'll die a warrior's death. IORVETH: I don't regret a thing. ROCHE: Impending death has addled your mind. IORVETH: I don't regret that it's you. After so many years, it would be stupid to die from an accidental bolt in the eye or, worse yet, influenza... ROCHE: Damn. Lucky again - your archers approach. I defeated you once, Iorveth, and I can do it again. Remember that. IORVETH: We shall see about that, friend. We shall see... It's high time we did. GERALT: Let's go. IORVETH: Prepare to set sail! Unfurl the mainsail! GERALT: We made it. IORVETH: This is just the beginning. But you chose the right side and I'm pleased. GERALT: Wish I could be so sure... [DANDELION, NARRATING: The assassin had had his day. He'd kidnapped Triss Merigold. It seemed like Foltest's life was not enough. It seemed like the killer also wanted the monarch's former advisor. &nbsp; There was no time to think, it was time to act. Grabbing Geralt, I embarked on a voyage upriver, deeper into the Pontar Valley. If the elves could be believed, it was there that free folk from all around had assembled there, beneath Vergen's banners, to resist the Kaedweni invader. &nbsp; I should mention the exceptional individuals who made up my fellowship for this voyage. I usually get nervous around Scoia'tael. I see them as scoundrels and murderers, and find their presence outright unwanted. But I must admit I was glad to have the help of Iorveth and his infamous bunch, who could prove highly helpful... help, helpful... That's not nice. &nbsp; Highly useful, then.] [Continued in Chapter II (Iorveth).] ",

    "content": "&lt; PREV CONTENTS [Geralt and the Blue Stripes gather around for Roche's mission briefing.] ROCHE: Listen very carefully - I'm not repeating this. We have two targets. The first is a Kaedweni spy - Arnolt Malliger. I want him alive. ROCHE: The other is Bernard Loredo, the trading post's commander and a traitor to Temeria. We don't let his kind live. ROCHE: Arnolt almost never leaves the residence, so we need to strike there. To get inside, we'll use Ves' unusual talents, and Bernard's habits. GERALT: Stop calling him by his first name. It really rubs me the wrong way. ROCHE: Whatever you wish. ROCHE: Loredo's house - the first floor contains guest quarters. Geralt had the opportunity to take a look. Regular patrols. Second floor... Loredo's bodyguards' quarters. They think they're the toughest warriors this side of the Yaruga, but really they're lame drowners dressed in colorful gambesons. ROCHE: Third floor, the lion's den. Here, Loredo stores plundered valuables. It's where he sleeps, shits and wanks off while staring at the statuette of a she-elf. Only the following are allowed to enter: Arnolt Malliger, Loredo's mother, his cousin and... whores. VES: Ha. I'm not sure I still have that frock... ROCHE: After making his round of the trading post, Loredo always orders two ladies. Ves will act as one of them. The house is a bloody fortress, but Loredo had it enlarged. The witcher will enter through the extension. Ves will open a window for you. ROCHE: Once in you'll have to improvise, Geralt, but you'll have the element of surprise. Ves can hold her own too. ROCHE: Zenin and Ryckard will provide cover from vantage points. If things get hot, lure those whoresons near the windows. I'll be in the courtyard with the rest, ready to enter in the extreme. I repeat, in the extreme. ROCHE: That's all. Any questions? No? Let's get to work. [Geralt can get into the compound one of two ways; either through the nekker cave or over a wall using a ladder the Stripes have set up.] [If Geralt goes through the cave] [Geralt climbs up the ladder at the end and drops down immediately into the storage compound where he found the kayran trap part. The sex worker Ves was partnered with is there alone.] GERALT: Where's Ves? HELEN: So that's her name. I knew she was no hooker. They've taken her to the tower. GERALT: Great, thanks. HELEN: Wait! The tower's locked. The soldiers upstairs guard the keys. GERALT: Damn! I need to get in there. HELEN: Loredo's mother also has keys. GERALT: Where is she? HELEN: In the basement, distilling fisstech. GERALT: Take care. HELEN: Kill the whoreson. [If Geralt goes over the ladder] [Geralt goes to meet the Stripes behind Loredo's compound after dark.] BLUE STRIPE: Your chariot awaits, fair youth. The good spirits of this tower will guide and protect you. Heh-heh. [Geralt climbs the ladder and drops down on the other side into Loredo's back lot. The merchant spy Roche wants is looking around with a torch.] ARNOLT: Where are you? Hiding? You like playing hide and seek? I'll find you. ARNOLT: Naughty girl. Daddy will have to punish you... ARNOLT: Come on, precious - you love it when I mount you. ARNOLT: Ah, we're playing hide and seek now? Wait till I find you, little sparrow! ARNOLT: You're getting on my nerves, skeezer. Show yourself right now! [Geralt knocks him out, then makes his way into the storage compound where he found the kayran trap part. The sex worker Ves was partnered with is there by herself.] HELEN: You're this new girl's friend? GERALT: Where is she? HELEN: The Commander took her to the tower. Hurry. GERALT: How did you know? HELEN: She was obviously not one of us - a hooker always knows a hooker. So I guessed something was gonna happen... Before they took her she whispered, \"Window in the extension.\" When that bastard went to take a pee, I noticed you climbing over the wall. GERALT: How do I get to Loredo? HELEN: When he's having it off, he lets no one in. But his mother has keys. HELEN: You must really love her, taking such risks... GERALT: Ri-ight... Where's the mother? HELEN: In the basement, distilling fisstech. GERALT: Thanks. Now go. Climb over the wall and run. If a tall man dressed in blue stops you, tell him everything. Tell him his plan was ingeniously simple. HELEN: Thank you. If you manage to enter the tower, kill the bastard, witcher. He should die slowly and painfully for all he did to us... [After talking to Helen, Geralt climbs a scaffolding and leaps through one of the windows of Loredo's house. At the same time, a cutscene shows Loredo snorting fisstech in a different room with Ves strung up against the wall. Geralt sneaks through the halls and finds Marietta in her lab.] MARIETTA: Oooooh! Who the hell are you? What do you want? GERALT: The key to the upper quarters. I know you have it. MARIETTA: You want to free the elven girl? Your efforts are in vain. Like in Ithlinne's prophecy - the seed has been planted and will soon sprout. GERALT: Shut up and give me the key. MARIETTA: Uh. The key, the key... Where did I put it...? [She throws fisstech in Geralt's eyes and comes at him with a knife. He kills her. In the room above, Loredo gropes Ves. Geralt makes his way up to the tower where Loredo is. He can hear Loredo through the door.] VES: Stay away. LOREDO: You're dressed like a whore - behave like one. First I'll plough you, and then I'll slice off your tits. Does that strike your fancy? VES: Cut off your own, whoreson. LOREDO: I love it when bitches bark. [Geralt enters the room.] MORIL: It's a trap! Look out! [Loredo lunges out with a halberd. Geralt dodges, then engages him.] LOREDO: Tougher to kill a soldier than a bandit, eh? GERALT: Yeah, you're tougher than your mother was. But you'll die just the same. LOREDO: What?!!! You bastard! LOREDO: Demavend should have killed all you freaks! VES: Kill the son of a bitch! VES: Make him die in pain! VES: What now, Loredo? Balls shriveling? [Geralt kills Loredo.] VES: Quick, untie me. VES: Geralt, we've no time to lose. She needs help. We need to get her out of here. [Geralt unties Ves.] VES: Thanks, Geralt. I heard something behind that door. [In the next room, an elf woman is lying on a bed, arms wrapped around her stomach.] MORIL: Don't leave me here, please... VES: You don't look like a whore, elf. MORIL: My name is Moril... what month is it? VES: This is no time to chat. Can you walk? MORIL: I'll not stay here any longer, even if I must crawl out. VES: She won't make it through the garden, Geralt. We must leave by the front. Lead the way - we'll be right behind you. MORIL: S-so what month is it? VES: Lammas. MORIL: Autumn's begun? When they kidnapped me... it was snowing. VES: And the child's father is...? MORIL: This child has only a mother. When I realized I was pregnant... I wanted to kill myself. VES: Don't say that... MORIL: I am Aen Seidhe. [Geralt goes first as Ves helps Moril down the stairs. Halfway down, Moril stops.] MORIL: I... I can't make it. I think I... VES: Damn, her water broke. Geralt, change of plans! GERALT: But... VES: Back to the tower. I need a clean bed, hot water and some time. We can't be disturbed... Go get help. [Geralt heads down to clear the way of guards and joins the fight in the courtyard. As the last of Loredo's men fall, Roche arrives.] ROCHE: Geralt! I see we're in time. GERALT: Where have you been, Roche? ROCHE: A little problem along the way. [Flashback to Iorveth and Roche's confrontation in the forest. The two circle each other, then engage in single combat.] [If Iorveth wins] IORVETH: The Temerian Special Forces, created by Foltest to combat the Scoia'tael after the first war with Nilfgaard. Veterans, professionals, the best of the best. This is the end, Roche. See these emblems? Temerian lilies - that's all I lacked. I've defeated the commanders of all the special forces in the North. Now, I shall unite the Scoia'tael... ROCHE: Finish what you started... IORVETH: I shan't kill you, Roche. We Aen Seidhe never kill the last specimens of dying breeds. Live on and remember who defeated you, remember he can do so again. Va fail, Vernon Roche. ROCHE: You're making a mistake, Iorveth. I will find you. [If Roche wins] IORVETH: Defeated by a dh'oine. I must be getting old... What now? ROCHE: Consider yourself lucky. Though you deserve torture, I lack the means, so I'll simply lop off your head. You'll die a warrior's death. IORVETH: I don't regret a thing. ROCHE: Impending death has addled your mind. IORVETH: I don't regret that it's you.

I defeated you once, Iorveth, and I can do it again. Remember that. IORVETH: We shall see about that, friend. We shall see... ROCHE: The whoreson ran away, but I'm sure he'll show up again. BLUE STRIPE: Bloody nonhumans. ROCHE: Enough of Iorveth. What's with Loredo and where's Ves? GERALT: Loredo's dead. I saved Ves, barely. ROCHE: What happened? GERALT: Your plan was hardly the most... [Ves interrupts them by running out onto the balcony, holding a baby.] VES: A boy, Geralt. A healthy boy. ROCHE: What the...? Whose child is that? GERALT: Moril's. ROCHE: Whose? GERALT: We found an elf woman Loredo kidnapped almost a year ago. He was the father. BLUE STRIPE: [spits] I'd never touch a she-elf. [Geralt hits the man.] ROCHE: Enough! We don't have time for that! The ship's waiting. [They hear a cry and run up after Ves, who is crouched over Moril's body, cradling the elf's slit wrists.] VES: Why did you do it? Why? [A commando attempts to lay a hand on Ves to comfort her.] VES: Don't touch me! BLUE STRIPE: I hate this town. ROCHE: Prepare the boat. We sail immediately. BLUE STRIPE: What about the kid? ROCHE: It's not coming with us. And who in this hellhole will take in a half-breed? GERALT: Seherim. Take it to Seherim in Lobinden. And make sure to tell him it's Moril's child. [Over the railing of Roche's departing boat, Geralt and Roche wave to Seherim, who has Moril's child cradled in his arms. [DANDELION, NARRATING: The assassin had had his day, very true. He'd kidnapped Triss Merigold. It seemed like Foltest's life had not been enough. It seemed like the killer also wanted the monarch's former advisor. &nbsp; There was no time to think, it was time to act. Grabbing Geralt, I embarked on a voyage upriver, deeper into the Pontar Valley. There, in a region known as Lormark, King Henselt of Kaedwen had made camp with his army. 'King' is the key word here - denoting the central figure in my plan to capture the kingslayer. &nbsp; The special forces of King May-the-Soil-Lie-Lightly-Upon-Him-Foltest had lost some of their customary enthusiasm, treating us to not one single joke of the 'how many ways can you skin an elf' variety. Which only geos to support my theory that the human mind is capable of producing a finite amount of horror before some manner of reflection springs itself upon it.] [Continued in Chapter II (Roche).] ",

All rights reserved to respective parties. The Witcher 2 Game Script is a fan project by Laurelnose intended to compile the dialogue of The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings into a readable format. This guide (obviously) contains spoilers. Most recent update: 17-Mar-2021 - First draft of Chapter I completed (Changelog) Sidequests directly related to a main quest (e.g. The Ballista during An Indecent Proposal) are nested within the main transcript. Unrelated sidequests have their own pages underneath the main act heading. Poker, arm wrestling, fistfighting, crafting quests, and “plotless” monster contracts such as the Endrega Contract have not been transcribed, since the amount of dialogue associated with them is minimal and they take a fair amount of effort to do. Character dialogue pages contain the conversations you can have with various NPCs unrelated to any questline—for instance, talking to Dandelion or Zoltan in Flotsam’s tavern. Overheard dialogue pages contain the voice lines that you can hear by coming into proximity of an NPC, without actually engaging them in a conversation. Questions, comments, and requests can be directed to laurelnose@protonmail.com. ",

Elves and dwarves inhabit ghettos. In ever increasing numbers, they flee to the forests to join Scoia'tael units. &nbsp; In Temeria, an unidentified assassin attempts to murder King Foltest.

They embrace, but are interrupted by a soldier opening the tent flap.] . TRISS: Witcher, are you up?! GERALT: Pfff... TRISS: His Majesty, King of Temeria, Pontar, Mahakam and Sodden, Senior Protector of Brugge... summons Master Geralt to appear before him. GERALT: Tell him I'll be there shortly. TRISS: Sorry to intrude like this, m'Lady, but the King... GERALT: We heard you. TRISS: A pleasant day to you, m'Lady, witcher. [Soldier leaves.] . GERALT: Stupid war... It could've been such a beautiful morning... TRISS: A war can never be stupid when waged by your king. There are no wise wars. GERALT: A wise war is a contradiction, Triss. TRISS: Then maybe you know just how I should advise our lustful monarch? GERALT: Stop falling in love, sire no further bastards, and don't wage stupid wars. TRISS: Genius. You know these bastards could vie for the throne in the future? Then we'd have an even more senseless conflict. GERALT: Which doesn't change the fact that... People are dying because of a lovers' spat... GERALT: They've cleared the forests, they're pillaging nearby villages, and they'll soon be murdering each other en masse. Why? Because Foltest's having a spat with the mother of his bastard twins... GERALT: This is a really stupid war, Triss. TRISS: Bastards or not, the children are still royal blood. The La Valettes are an old Temerian dynasty and the mix is sufficient basis to vie for the crown... History has known stranger contenders. GERALT: Which doesn't change the fact that... TRISS: I know, Foltest and the other northern monarchs are neither the smartest nor the most refined. But they're kings, one of whom we serve. GERALT: And I'll see Foltest as summoned - protect him if need be - but once the castle falls, we leave. [Geralt puts on his armor, not looking at Triss.] . TRISS: Did you dream of the Wild Hunt again? GERALT: Mhm... A scout reported seeing a dragon. GERALT: One of the scouts swears he saw a dragon down by the river... Claims he ran into a Scoia'tael unit. That would've been it if the dragon hadn't swooped down. The elves apparently bowed in prayer and he escaped. TRISS: A dragon? In the midst of civilization? Please... Besides, does it matter? Witchers don't hunt dragons. Or has something changed? GERALT: Nothing's changed. And you're right, it's probably not a dragon. Although it could be a forktail or a slyzard, maybe even an overgrown wyvern... TRISS: The scout ran into some elves and scurried away - that's how that story begins and ends. Learn anything about the assassin? GERALT: The unlucky assassin - how did the autopsy go? TRISS: It was a nightmare. In the month since you killed him, the King's medics poked around in his corpse like a bunch of amateurs. What arrived in that cart... well, I wouldn't even call it a corpse... GERALT: Foltest has some trust issues. Did you learn anything? TRISS: His pupils suggested he could probably see in the dark as well as you. I couldn't put an age on him. GERALT: The killer snuck past all the guards and nearly killed Foltest and me a month ago. And now you tell me he was a witcher? TRISS: Possibly. I'm just saying what the autopsy showed. I haven't told anyone, nor do I plan to. I know what it could do to you if it got out. TRISS: You might be a savior, a king's witcher now, but masters can be as fickle as the colts they ride... That dream... GERALT: I get the feeling that dream's important. Running franticly through the forest, the Wild Hunt – they're the last things I remember. GERALT: I wake up and try to relive the dream and the memory, hoping I'll find some guidance. Some clue to grab onto, something that'll help me recover my memory... TRISS: Dreams can be very powerful. Some people claim they can even shape reality. GERALT: People claim a lot of things. The problem is - it's often nonsense. TRISS: We'll know in time, I'm sure of it. Time to go. GERALT: All right. Time to look to the lustful king and his stupid war. TRISS: I'll join you later. ",

I wager you'll send the La Valettes running... NEWBOY: I just know I'm gonna die... Shite, I don't wanna die on a bet. KENNET: It's the Crinfrid Reavers' honor that's at stake here. This is no time to whimper. DESBRUT: You one of us or not? KENNET: Ooh! Lookie there, Newboy, it's that witcher... Geralt of Rivia ought to know about amulets. NEWBOY: Witcher, sir! I've a question for you... GERALT: We know each other? KENNET: Don't recognize your old mates? We're the Crinfrid Reavers. GERALT: I lost my memory. DESBRUT: As did Boholt! After the hunt for the golden dragon, he took a spill and hit his head on a rock. He can still be a beast in battle, but 'sides that, he don't do much save eat and shit. Rarely even lusts after women... GERALT: I doubt that's amnesia... KENNET: I'm Kennet, and this one here they call Desbrut, and this is Newboy - he's, uh, apprenticing with us, like. Haven't had much luck with monsters of late, so we enlisted. Now Newboy's gotten hisself into this wager situation...Would you help us for old time's sake? KENNET: I mean, we all got a little riled, but those are bygones, as I see it... DESBRUT: We'd have set you free, the sorceress, too. Boholt was just foolin' about the rapin' and all. Rape? GERALT: What rape? KENNET: Shut your trap, Desbrut. The witcher don't remember - waste of words to remind him. We're old mates, that's that. GERALT: So you'd have raped this old mate? KENNET: Just the sorceress. You were there to kill the dragon, the sorceress, too, the peasants wanted at it, everyone did... But, there was only one prize. And we argued, there was some commotion, a regular rumble, in fact. KENNET: We tied you up like hogs, meanin' you and the sorceress, and went after the beast. But that dragon thrashed us so hard we spent the next half year lickin' our wounds. And you done freed yourselves of your bonds... GERALT: Who was the sorceress? KENNET: Raven-haired she was... Hm, remember her name Desbrut? DESBRUT: Err, Connifer or some such... So, willin' to help some old friends, witcher? I don't have time for this. GERALT: Sorry, I'm fresh out of time. The King's summoned me. DESBRUT: Aww, piss off, witcher. You haven't changed a bit. Just ploughin' a different witch! GERALT: What was that? KENNET: Newboy, grab your sword. You only live once. Let the knighthood see that we Crinfrid Reavers... GERALT: Wait, this sorceress... KENNET: No time to help your mates, but you're glad to stop and talk about some bird, eh? DESBRUT: Maybe we ought to try this talisman on the witcher... KENNET: We'd hang. He's the King's favorite now. They're sounding the assembly. That's us. NEWBOY: I'll feel like a git going out in knickers alone...You sure it'll work? KENNET: Let's go! GERALT: There's clearly magic in the trinket, but I doubt it'll deflect swords or arrows... NEWBOY: Shit, I knew it. I told you so, you idiot... DESBRUT: Screw honor. Don your metal, Newboy, you'll go into battle confessional and all. KENNET: So be it, though I'd like to have fleeced the noble. Damn shame... What's the problem? [Same as \"What's the story with the wager?\"] . What's the story with the wager? KENNET: It's a matter of life, death and quite a bit of coin, in point of fact... Newboy bet a knight that he'll survive the assault in his shirt and knickers alone. We'd drunk a bit by then, I admit, but a wager's a wager - our honor's at stake. GERALT: A soldier's honor versus a knight's? I think I get it. KENNET: The very core of the matter, witcher. We're slated to go in the first wave, so the going's liable to be hard. Newboy's brave, but he can't survive by courage alone... In any case, we've come into this bauble that's supposed to protect him, magically like. KENNET: You mind casting an expert's glance at it, seeing as sorcery and such is not strange to you...? GERALT: Lemme see this bauble. NEWBOY: Your wolf medallion! I saw it shake! GERALT: It reacts to magic... DESBRUT: So it's true, what the priest said? Hear that, Newboy? You'll be safe. We'll fleece that knight, we will! The amulet could help. GERALT: Who knows. The amulet just might help. KENNET: All right, that settles it. The witcher says the amulet'll help. NEWBOY: Farkin' hell. I'll not go into battle in me knickers alone! KENNET: Nuggin, we win that wager, we'll be rich men, remember that. Besides, what's the joy in taking a castle in full plate? They'll sing ballads about you, I tell you. KENNET: They're sounding the assembly... That's us. Thanks, witcher. We'll be sure to get you a share of those winnings. DESBRUT: And who knows, we might get another shot at that golden dragon some day... I doubt it. GERALT: There's clearly magic in the trinket, but I doubt it'll deflect swords or arrows... DESBRUT: Shit, I knew it. I told you so, you idiot... DESBRUT: Screw honor. Don your metal, Newboy, you'll go into battle confessional and all. KENNET: So be it, though I'd like to have fleeced the noble. Damn shame... Where did you get this? GERALT: Where did you get this talisman? KENNET: We came by it, let's say... KENNET: We were on patrol, see, and ran into a couple of novice priestesses praying at this shrine... They were nice, smiling and all... DESBRUT: We done wanted to take them two on patrol, ooooh, but...! KENNET: Shut it! Boholt had one of his rare moments of clairvoyance, went rummaging in the shrine and found the amulet... DESBRUT: Who knows what goes on in that head of his, but every now and then he wakes up as good old Boholt. KENNET: Aye, he still cuts 'em down with a single wallop. In any case, we took the amulet and went off to find the rest of the patrol. Ah, the wonders we saw! First ran into some Squirrels, vicious ones, arrows flyin' everywhere, but we came through untouched... Barely three of the others still standing when a dragon swooped down, the elves fell to their knees, and we all legged it. The amulet's magic for certain... GERALT: Though it failed to protect the shrine from your patrolling... KENNET: Aye, true. Well, now we dunno what to think. I'd say the amulet could help you. [Same as \"The amulet could help.\"] . It's infused with magic, though what kind, I don't know. [Same as \"I doubt it.\"] . Seems to me the amulet brings trouble. GERALT: Who knows. Maybe the amulet is unlucky, maybe it draws trouble. I doubt you left the shrine untouched... Then the Scoia'tael, the dragon... DESBRUT: I told you as much! We need to get the boy some plate! KENNET: Wait a minute. We owe the witcher some thanks.... DESBRUT: But we're broke as shit peddlers... KENNET: Fancy the amulet, witcher? It might draw trouble, be cursed in some way, but you might lift the curse, sell it off... All right. GERALT: I'll take it. KENNET: It's all yours. No chance. GERALT: I have problems enough as it is. DESBRUT: Witcher, you available for normal business still? Willin' to hunt monsters? GERALT: Yeah, I'm willin'. Why do you ask? DESBRUT: Well, cos we were out with those scouts that saw the dragon... No one believes us, but... KENNET: They're sounding the assembly... That's us. But we'll find you after the battle, witcher. GERALT: Wait... KENNET: Farewell. ",

Foltest is talking to Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen, the Nilfgaardian ambassador.] . FOLTEST: A beautiful day for battle! Fear not, Excellency, we're out of range of their arbalists. SHILARD: I'm no warrior, Sire, I must admit. I prefer to joust verbally or with a pen, the emissary of peace that I am... FOLTEST: Hogwash! You're the emissary of the White Flame Dancing on the Graves of His Foes, the Emperor of Nilfgaard, who spared no blood conquering over a dozen sovereign realms! SHILARD: Thus bringing them laws, culture and peace above all. FOLTEST: Finally! Traitors of the realm boil tar on the walls while you dally with the royal advisor. GERALT: How may I assist you, Sire? FOLTEST: We mount an assault today, and you'll be at my side. Follow me, gentlemen, let's not keep the traitors waiting. [A ballista missile strikes the ground nearby.] . SHILARD: Sire, you said we were out of range... FOLTEST: That was a ballista, Excellency. Its arms strengthened with bronze plates and strung with horsehair, it can propel heavy bolts up to a mile away. A deadly and very costly weapon. FOLTEST: An experienced crew can cock and release two bolts each minute. Yet it has one flaw. SHILARD: Your Grace, please take cover! FOLTEST: The recoil of the arms is so strong upon firing... [Another missile strikes, further away.] . FOLTEST: ...that the weapon shifts. It simply cannot hit the same spot twice. SHILARD: I had no idea Your Grace was a learned military engineer... FOLTEST: I'm not. I gave the baroness those ballistae two years ago, for her birthday... SCARRED SOLDIER: Sire... FOLTEST: What say you, Excellency, of men who live in spite of such wounds? SHILARD: And what say you, Your Grace, of soldiers who inflict them? SCARRED SOLDIER: Those who did this live no more! SHILARD: Master Geralt, I wish to converse with you once the storm of battle has subsided. GERALT: Forgive me, Excellency, but I plan to leave the royal court as soon as possible. SHILARD: Might I know why? GERALT: Too often they take me for someone I'm not. FOLTEST: What do they call you, soldier? Wait! You served with me at Brenna and during our foray into the Pontar Valley... Norman Sador. Still an arbalist? NORMAN: Yes, Sire. Fate has not been kind to me. FOLTEST: Hah! Norman Sador, for your years of faithful service to the Crown, I appoint you decurion of the arbalists! FOLTEST: Onwards, gentlemen. No reason to dawdle. SHILARD: Forgive my candor, Your Majesty, but I must ask: What fate awaits the royal bastards when... FOLTEST: They're my children! If I hear \"bastard\" one more time someone will die! Painfully! SHILARD: Your Grace, forgive me, but the laws of succession are irrefutably clear... FOLTEST: Piss on the laws! I'll change them, if need be! Above all, I'll not allow a band of treacherous barons to use my children as their banner. SHILARD: Your Majesty is entirely within his rights. [If no Witcher 1 save is imported, or if Adda is dead] FOLTEST: Adda is dead. And I have no other children... SHILARD: I see. FOLTEST: This conversation is over, Excellency. Please retire to your tent. [If a Witcher 1 save is imported with Adda alive] FOLTEST: Thanks to Geralt of Rivia, my daughter, Adda, is alive and is now the wife of Radovid of Redania. SHILARD: I see. FOLTEST: I fear you do not, Excellency. The midget king merely awaits my demise. SHILARD: I am certain King Radovid of Redania wishes Your Majesty a long and healthy life. FOLTEST: That wasn't even amusing, Excellency. The old families will never accept a Redanian on my throne. Adda will have to content herself with Redania. SHILARD: I understand - the issue of succession remains unresolved. Your Grace, I request your permission to retire. FOLTEST: You have it. FOLTEST: Black Ones in my camp before a battle - what has the world come to? Nothing would make me happier than returning his shriveled head to Emhyr in a sack... But Triss Merigold insisted I be patient and courteous. Was I? As ever, Sire. GERALT: I couldn't have handled it better myself. FOLTEST: Hah! I always knew you were one of us. And bugger what folk say. They talked about Adda no end... Not quite, Sire. GERALT: Not really. I actually saw His Excellency sweat. But that'll be our secret. FOLTEST: Hah! You brought your sense of humor along. FOLTEST: Have you learned anything about the assassin? He could've been a witcher. GERALT: Triss did an autopsy. It's possible he was a witcher. FOLTEST: A witcher? What have I ever done to the ploughing witchers? Anything more? GERALT: He had no medallion, but that doesn't mean anything. FOLTEST: Many in your shoes would have withheld that information. FOLTEST: After the battle, Triss will report to me. For now, let us tend to the traitors. Nothing new. [Default if Triss didn't tell you about the autopsy.] GERALT: Nothing new, Sire. A month's passed and we don't know any more than we knew when we began. This investigation's going nowhere... FOLTEST: My agents have learned little, also. But we'll find the culprits, it's just a question of time. Now for the battle. FOLTEST: I want you at my side today. Then you may go where you please. GERALT: Thank you, Sire. [Foltest and Geralt continue up the hill where soldiers are manning the ballistae.] . FOLTEST: Where are you aiming, imbeciles?! Soldier, spyglass! FOLTEST: What is going on up there...? The gods! Count Etcheverry! Catch, witcher. [Foltest tosses the spyglass to Geralt, who raises it to his eye.] . FOLTEST: Aim for the rogue with the red plume! Not six months ago he swore eternal friendship to me! Quickly! How much higher? One and half degrees. FOLTEST: Did we hit the bastard? GERALT: He's down. FOLTEST: Hah! One less traitor. Time to attack. Follow me, witcher. Two and a half degrees. / Three degrees. FOLTEST: Did we hit the bastard? GERALT: He ducked. FOLTEST: Dammit! We'll get him on the walls. Follow me, witcher! ",

We ought to stuff those La Valette lackeys with tar and sulfur and feed 'em to the beast! SOLDIER 2: Listen, creep - stop meddling in other people's business! [SUCCESS] SOLDIER 1: It's awfully caring of yous. But all right, we'll leave. Plenty more booty lying around. SOLDIER 2: Let's go. Fine. [EXIT] GERALT: I'm outta here. SOLDIER: A wise decision. MAN: Thank you sir, thank you... Take care of yourselves. GERALT: Be careful. You may not be so lucky next time. Help comes at a price. GERALT: I help people. That's how I make a living. MAN: We know... MAN: Here... take this pouch... GERALT: Find a place to hide. MAN: I must find my wife first. They herded her away with others like cattle... GERALT: Good luck.

TEMERIAN SOLDIER: Fire will cleanse your tainted souls. TEMERIAN SOLDIER: Faster with those logs! GERALT: What the hell's going on here? COMMANDER: Not your concern. Leave these people alone. GERALT: Leave them alone! They're innocent! COMMANDER: Innocent?! They're with the La Valettes! Weeds that need to be ripped out with their roots so they won't grow back again! Treason spreads like the plague. No one will leave here alive. And you - stay out of this! I won't let you hurt these people. GERALT: I won't stand by while you murder innocents. COMMANDER: So, what'll you do? GERALT: Kill you. COMMANDER: I was not after your blood! I have witnesses! [Geralt engages the commander in single combat.] . COMMANDER: You win. Mercy. GERALT: Let the people out and walk away. COMMANDER: Unblock the door! COMMANDER: I'll report this. GERALT: Yeah, you do that. [Geralt enters the building.] . OLD WOMAN: Leave us be! GERALT: You're free. MAN: Thank you, m'Lord. I need to be paid. GERALT: I can't live on gratitude alone. OLD WOMAN: We're poor, sir! [INTIMIDATION] Poor don't mean broke... GERALT: Do I need to search your pockets? [FAILURE] MAN: You must believe us. We have nothin'. [SUCCESS] MAN: Th-th-this is all w-we h-have left... I s-swear... GERALT: That looks about right to me. OLD WOMAN: Bastard...! Just my luck. GERALT: Damn. OLD WOMAN: Rogue... Be careful. GERALT: Find a place to hide until this madness ends. MAN: But where...? . [After finding a way into the temple through the sewers, Geralt looks through a wall opening to see elves lingering by boats on the riverbank.] . GERALT: Scoia'tael... [Geralt fights his way through the guards and opens the gate from the inside to let Roche and Foltest into the template.] . FOLTEST: You have just become the most titled witcher in the world. And the wealthiest. GERALT: I'll remind you of that when this is all over, Sire. FOLTEST: See, Vernon? Geralt succeeded. ROCHE: Lucky he did. The priest was downright discourteous and went off to meet his gods. GERALT: I saw Scoia'tael on the river. ROCHE: Where? How many? What colors did they wear? FOLTEST: Plough the elves. We'll tend to them later. The monastery awaits! ",

FOLTEST: Arthur Tailles, erstwhile Count of Nessvelt. I signed your sentence. TAILLES: Yes, yet the Baroness saw fit to pardon me. An awkward situation, to be sure. FOLTEST: Anais and Boussy... where are they? TAILLES: The royal children? FOLTEST: Don't test my patience, Tailles, and I'll grant you a quick death. ARCHPRIEST: Confess, Foltest! Before the gods and the people! Boussy and Anais are the fruit of your loins! Bow to the Gods and admit the truth! FOLTEST: You may not have noticed, Tailles, but I just took this town. TAILLES: Aided by murderers, sorcerers and a mutant for whom nothing is holy. ARCHPRIEST: This is hallowed ground! You will not raise your hand against a servant of the gods! [AXII] Where are the children? GERALT: Where have you taken the children? ARCHPRIEST: The solar... They're in the solar. TAILLES: What is this? Blasphemy! Sorcerer's tricks! Shut up.

FOLTEST: Damn, I've seen assaults go awry, but the dragon topples them all. ROCHE: Tops. FOLTEST: Tops what? ROCHE: Well... tops all. FOLTEST: Damn nonsense! Geralt, you should know... Is it possible to tame a dragon? GERALT: Not as far as I know. ROCHE: Then why is this reptile eating only my men?! FOLTEST: Let's hope Merigold got out of there. GERALT: I'm sure she did. ROCHE: If not, you'll need a new advisor, Sire. GERALT: Shut up, Roche. ROCHE: It's possible that the dragon simply... GERALT: Another word from you and the dragon will not be your main concern. FOLTEST: Enough! Both of you! [As they come out onto the bridge, the dragon reappears.] . FOLTEST: The dragon's back! [Geralt helps Foltest across the bridge, and wedges his silver sword into the dragon's mouth, saving them both.] . FOLTEST: You saved my life again. Ask what you will of me, witcher - within reason, of course. GERALT: I need to leave, Sire. I'd like Triss Merigold to come with me. If she wants... FOLTEST: Are you blind? She's enamored with you. FOLTEST: You may leave and none shall stop you. You have my word. [At the top of the stairs, they find Anais and Boussy playing together with Letho disguised as a blind monk looking after them.] . LETHO: Who goes there? FOLTEST: Foltest. I've come for my children. Geralt, wait here, you might scare them... LETHO: Aaaah... Thanks be to the gods. My prayers are answered. [Anais goes to hug her father, but Boussy hesitates.] . LETHO: Go, Boussy. BOUSSY: That's not my father. LETHO: But it is your king, boy. LETHO: Bells... Your triumph is complete - the city and fortress taken, Sire. Time to thank the Forefather and the Mother Creatrix for this great victory. FOLTEST: A moment, blind man. I've not seen my children in six months. The gods can spare another minute. FOLTEST: Listen to me. Your mother and I quarreled, but that is over. She was deceived - evil men turned her against me. These men have been punished and all will be well from now. FOLTEST: No tears, Boussy. One day you'll be King and kings do not weep. LETHO: Armed men approach, Sire... Children, go to the refectory. FOLTEST: My knights will soon be here. You must meet them, for one day you will rule them. Boussy, go wash your face - they must not see that you wept.

ROCHE: Foltest, King of Temeria... has been murdered. Unfortunately for you, you're the only suspect. GERALT: The murderer outsmarted you, so I'm to rot in this dungeon. ROCHE: Oh, no danger of you rotting - you'll hang. GERALT: Convince them otherwise. ROCHE: I have no influence over the court. Foltest talked about you... GERALT: Foltest told me a lot about you. ROCHE: If not for him, I'd be a drunk or a vagrant. Foltest did more for me than my father ever did. But then, my father did exactly nothing for I never even met him. In any case, I'll not rest until the murderer is punished. GERALT: Tell me how you serve, Vernon. ROCHE: I carry out orders others are incapable of executing. What's happening in the kingdom? GERALT: What's the situation in Temeria? ROCHE: The Council of Regents has convened to restore order. That means three things: utter chaos will prevail, Vizima will run dry of wine and strong drink, and the local whores will make a killing. GERALT: Is Triss participating in the meetings? ROCHE: Indeed. Only to find out that she's no longer needed. GERALT: How do you know? ROCHE: It's my business to know. GERALT: They want to run a kingdom without a sorceress? ROCHE: They already have a kingdom without a king - they'll use every opportunity to get rid of her. GERALT: Who will rule? ROCHE: The chief contenders are Count Maravel and Baron Kimbolt, who already tussle for control of La Valette Castle. GERALT: What about Foltest's bastards...? ROCHE: The King's blood runs in their veins, so yes, they are entitled to the throne, not some drooling nobles. Triss will vouch for me. GERALT: What if someone vouched for me? ROCHE: You have a witness? GERALT: I was thinking of Triss. ROCHE: Were she not your lover, who knows...But it's common knowledge she is. GERALT: What happened to her? ROCHE: Well, she's fine. She's been invited to the next meeting of the Council of Regents. I'm not the murderer. GERALT: For fuck's sake, you command the Blue Stripes. Do something! The real murderer is free, and he's further and further away with every hour you spend prancing around in here. ROCHE: I find the killer-monk story unconvincing. GERALT: I don't claim he was a monk. He was wearing a frock, though. He sailed off in a boat with some Scoia'tael. ROCHE: Would you recognize him? GERALT: No problem. A mountain of meat - never seen anyone bigger. [Roche gets up and paces.] . ROCHE: What would you do if you escaped? None of your business. GERALT: I'd go have a beer. ROCHE: Are you trying to annoy me? GERALT: Vernon... If I escaped, you'd be the last to learn my plans. ROCHE: Let me tell you a story. GERALT: I hate stories. ROCHE: There was once a witcher who was accused of murdering a monarch. GERALT: Wrongly accused. ROCHE: The charges against him were very serious and only one man could help him. GERALT: Let me guess - a handsome prince. ROCHE: The commander of the Blue Stripes. Sadly, the witcher refused his help and was hanged. GERALT: I prefer happy endings. ROCHE: Then help me, Geralt. You win. I'm willing to talk - candidly. GERALT: Looks like I'm out of options - let's do this your way. ROCHE: What would you do if you were freed? [Continues the same as \"I'd hunt down the killer.\"] . Go fuck yourself. I've already told you I didn't do it... GERALT: What do you want from me, Roche? I already told you it wasn't me. On top of that, I don't know who's behind it, and frankly, I don't really give a damn. Could've been anyone, as I see it - King Demavend, even. ROCHE: Demavend is dead. GERALT: Is that true? [Roche gets up and walks around to stand behind Geralt.] . ROCHE: He was murdered. GERALT: Uh-huh. I did that, too. ROCHE: You were in Vizima at the time. I checked. GERALT: My doppelganger was in Vizima. I have three of them. ROCHE: I'm no fool. GERALT: You sure act like one. ROCHE: I'm to learn who killed the King. And I will. GERALT: You know I didn't, but you need to prove a point. Sons of whores like you would rather hang an innocent man than admit failure. ROCHE: Don't ever call me a whore's son again. [INTIMIDATION] [Attack him.] [Geralt attacks Roche. Ves shoots him in the back with a crossbow.] . ROCHE: Another prisoner killed while trying to escape. VES: Yes, sir. [GAME OVER] I can help you get the kingslayer. GERALT: You wanna get Foltest's murderer? Let's do it together. ROCHE: Now you're talking. GERALT: If you want me to help, treat me like a human, not a hog. ROCHE: What do you want? I'd hunt down the killer. GERALT: I'd go after the kingslayer. ROCHE: You know where to look for him? GERALT: Some Scoia'tael helped him escape. That's where I'd start. I expect you might know this particular group of elves... ROCHE: How'd you work that out? GERALT: They wore blue-striped masks. Trophies, I expect. ROCHE: Iorveth's commando. I know where to find them. We've a trail to follow after all. GERALT: If you want to start over, and take it easy this time, get me some food. ROCHE: Now that you mention it... Ves! Bring us food and drink. GERALT: Huh! Shame you didn't think of that earlier. ROCHE: It's your own fault, Geralt. Your fate is in your hands. [Ves returns with food.] . ROCHE: Thank you. GERALT: Never heard of women serving in the special forces. ROCHE: Ves is one of my best people. GERALT: How'd she wind up in the Blue Stripes? ROCHE: I pulled her from the paws of the Scoia'tael. Just sixteen when they torched her village and slaughtered everyone. The unit commander took a liking and spared her. ROCHE: One last thing: this file is about one Geralt of Rivia. GERALT: And Foltest's death? ROCHE: Actually, Geralt's death. The report details events from five years ago... [Geralt experiences a flashback to his death. NARRATOR: Rivia - population 1234. In that, 253 nonhumans. &nbsp; September 25, 1268 - a riot erupts, a massacre ensues. The streets run with the blood of elves and dwarves. One person finds the courage to face the raging crowd. &nbsp; During the rioting, 76 nonhumans perish, including the witcher, Geralt of Rivia, stabbed in the chest with a pitchfork by a man of whom we know only that his name was Rob and he owed 3 crowns at the local tavern. Yennefer of Vengerberg dies trying to heal the witcher... &nbsp; The bodies of Geralt and the sorceress are taken away by a mysterious young girl with ashen hair. Their place of internment remains unknown.] GERALT: I remember... Rivia, Yennefer... ROCHE: What just happened? GERALT: I saw... I saw my own death... ROCHE: And the rest? Have you regained all your memory? GERALT: That's all. I just remember the end... ROCHE: Ves! Interrogation's done. Restrain the prisoner. [Ves comes in and locks Geralt's hands behind his back.] . ROCHE: I'll take the key. ROCHE: I sail upriver at dawn. Guards will collect you in five minutes. Eat. You'll need your strength... [Roche leaves the key in front of Geralt, and exits.] . ",

Did Foltest hurt her? He provided her with some protection. GERALT: He ordered the Blue Stripes to guard her like some invaluable treasure. Soon afterward, he was dead himself. ARYAN: But you did not slay him? GERALT: No, Aryan. I didn't kill him. ARYAN: Do you know who did? GERALT: No. But I intend to find out. I don't know. GERALT: Sorry, I have no idea.

LOUISA: In that case, let us go. Along the way, you can tell me how my son, Aryan La Valette, died... [Before they can leave the room, Shilard and two Nilfgaardian soldiers enter.] . SHILARD: They never miss. They're the elite of the Nilfgaardian army. They look like show dancers. GERALT: You're kidding, right? There are only two of them. SHILARD: Holding two of the best crossbows in the world. Here for the interrogation? GERALT: Your Excellency - here to oversee the interrogation? SHILARD: I have come to assist the Baroness La Valette, former mistress of this castle. But I see she has found her champion already. LOUISA: What do you want, Excellency? SHILARD: To aid you, m'Lady. Or rather, to present a proposal. LOUISA: The La Valettes have never made and will never make a pact with Nilfgaard. SHILARD: Panta rei, Baroness. There are no constants in this world. It is time to adapt to the new order. Particularly now that Aryan and the King are no more. You and the royal children require protection. LOUISA: Where are they? SHILARD: In the upper castle. They are safe, unhurt thus far. I can guarantee their further safety and yours provided you can agree to Imperial protection, stomach, as it were, Nilfgaardians in your presence. Naturally, I expect nothing in return. LOUISA: You contradict yourself, Ambassador, your ruse is not lost on me. But so be it. Now, take me to my children. GERALT: I hadn't planned on going to the upper castle. SHILARD: And rightly so. Many there tremble with anticipation for tomorrow's execution. I must resolve a few 'administrative' matters to deliver the Baroness from this oppression, and I will occupy, for ample time, I think, the guards at the main dungeon gate in the process. M'Lady, I leave you in the hands of this honorable knight. Witcher, count twenty heartbeats and follow me. GERALT: Why would you aid a kingslayer, Excellency? SHILARD: I aid a witcher who may find the real regicide. I'm a principled man who abhors all acts of violence, in addition to which the Empire I represent needs a stable North. But we digress. Twenty heartbeats, then follow. When I faced Aryan, I had no choice. GERALT: M'Lady, your son Aryan gave me no choice... LOUISA: I know. Stubborn to the last as the La Valettes have always been. I trust he did not suffer...? GERALT: I doubt he even sensed the final blow coming. LOUISA: There's that, at least. You have spoken your piece, witcher. Go. As usual, the ambassador is playing his games. GERALT: I wouldn't trust him, m'Lady. LOUISA: Do you believe I have a choice, witcher? By your estimation, how is it I find myself imprisoned now? The old families led by Kimbolt and Maravel wish to reap all they can for themselves. They dream of one of their own donning the crown, and my children are but an impediment. We require protection, and the Nilfgaardian knows this well. It is time. Go, witcher. [If you go the other direction away from the trapdoor, Geralt instead witnesses two Nilfgaardian soldiers bring Louisa out into the hall where Shilard is waiting.] . SHILARD: I am Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen, emissary of the Empire of Nilfgaard and its most divine Emperor Emhyr var Emreis... LOUISA: What do you want of me, Nilfgaardian? SHILARD: Simply to speak, m'Lady. LOUISA: Ah, really...? Something you would not dare were my son still alive. SHILARD: I very much regret the death of the Baron La Valette. Please accept my deepest condolences. Yet it is precisely his loss that renders our conversation mutually desirable. LOUISA: Let go of me! I shall walk unaided. [Towards door of torture chamber] I shall return, rogue! And I shall repay you! SHILARD: Let us go, m'Lady. Your cries can do us no good. [Geralt makes his way to a room where Shilard and Louisa are talking.] SHILARD: The La Valettes are a powerful dynasty, as the Emperor is fully aware. LOUISA: What do you and your emperor want? SHILARD: To take care of you, m'Lady. And your progeny, of course. LOUISA: Selflessly? SHILARD: That was unnecessary. [Geralt opens the door.] SHILARD: Come in, Master Geralt. Allow me to introduce the Baroness La Valette, mother to the royal children, who at present mourns the passing of her eldest son... GERALT: M'Lady. SHILARD: I comfort the baroness with assurances that House La Valette need suffer no more, its future brighter as it stands protected by the Empire of Nilfgaard. LOUISA: Did you kill my son Aryan? He gave me no choice. GERALT: I had no choice. He knew what can happen once swords are drawn and begin to swing. He chose death over shame. LOUISA: Stubborn like his father and grandfather before him. Honor above all. How did he die? Did he suffer? GERALT: No, I doubt he felt the final blow, didn't even see it coming. LOUISA: There's that, I suppose. Many perished in this war, not just your son. GERALT: M'lady, I killed many during the assault, not just your son. War demands sacrifices - you might remember that the next time you're about to start one. SHILARD: Have some compassion, Master Geralt. The baroness requires support, she is distraught as it is... LOUISA: Unnecessary toil, Excellency, for witchers have no feelings. And the truth, especially when painful, can wake us from the slumber of self-deception. I deserved as much. [Continues the same as \"Your son despised Nilfgaard.\"] Your son despised Nilfgaard. GERALT: M'Lady, I wouldn't trust the ambassador if I were you. SHILARD: Master Geralt, let us be serious, please... LOUISA: Let him speak. I wish to hear this. GERALT: I didn't know your son, but I know he saw the Empire as a foe. As did King Foltest. LOUISA: You've no notion of the events transpiring in the kingdom, of what Kimbolt, Maravel and their ilk are capable. My duty is to Foltest's children, their safety. And though I, too, see a pact with Nilfgaard as a pact with the devil, I feel I have no choice. Besides, can you say that you really knew the King? GERALT: Well enough to be confident of my words. LOUISA: Truly? In that case, what kind of a man was he? I wish to know your view. He was tough and ruthless - a good king. GERALT: He was ruthless, hard and effective. A good king. LOUISA: Effectiveness is the mark of a good witcher. We've learned to expect other things from monarchs - say, justice and wisdom... GERALT: Few are born wise, m'Lady. He did all he could to preserve and safeguard the realm. He was like any other man, except born to wear a crown. GERALT: He laughed at pleasantries, envied those better than him, feared those stronger, despised the weaker, and killed those he hated... Those he loved, he presented with ballistae... He was a man like any other, except he was born to be king. LOUISA: True, he was a boor in a crown... SHILARD: M'Lady! LOUISA: And that was the first and last honest epitaph he'll get. Once the poets start in, nothing will remain of the real Foltest. SHILARD: M'Lady, you will set down your memoirs - I shall make that my mission... Once we bring in the appropriate artist... LOUISA: Later, Excellency. All in due time. I'm not one to judge. GERALT: M'Lady, those of my profession generally live longer by not judging the nobly born. Especially crowned heads they're accused of murdering... LOUISA: If there's any truth to the accusation, you stand to lose nothing by speaking. GERALT: I didn't kill Foltest. What's more, I intend to find the man who did. He used everything and everyone. GERALT: Conceit, greed, lechery, anger... All the human demons gorged themselves on Foltest. Though those traits might've issued more from the office than the man. Who knows... SHILARD: Master Geralt, I've hitherto disregarded the rumors of you being a monster slayer and philosopher in equal measures... Yet a philosopher you are, and a subversive one at that... LOUISA: The ambassador questioned your guilt... It seems now that I, too, believe you did not slay the King. LOUISA: Your Excellency, you will aid the witcher to escape the castle. That is my wish. SHILARD: But M'Lady, this would represent an immeasurable risk in my estimation. And there is the matter of your son... LOUISA: He chose his fate and departed in a manner worthy of the La Valettes. How am I to believe you'll protect me from reptiles like Kimbolt and Maravel when you balk at the notion of deceiving a few prison guards? SHILARD: M'Lady, I shall do what is in my power. Give me a moment, witcher, then proceed to the main gate. [Geralt leaves. As Geralt makes his way out of the castle, Shilard distracts the guards.] ",

GERALT: The young Reaver of Crinfrid... a lot of good that amulet did him. [If Newboy wore armor into battle and survived, Geralt meets him when he exits the castle.] NEWBOY: Halt! Blimey, is that you, witcher? They say you killed the King. GERALT: Well, I didn't. And I'm going to prove it. NEWBOY: I'm inclined to believe you. GERALT: Glad to hear that. It'd be pretty stupid if I had to kill you now. Did all the Reavers survive the assault? NEWBOY: Aye, they've been drinkin' themselves silly for two days now. I believe I owe you something. GERALT: You don't owe me a thing. NEWBOY: We wound up in a boiling cauldron during the assault... You know how it is when knights get caught in a tight passage. Nowhere to go - those in the back push forward, those in the front are stuck, and halberd blows raining down from above... I'd've been crushed if not for my armor. NEWBOY: And about ten blows landed on my helmet. My ears still ring and I puke time and again, but I live and breathe. GERALT: Concussion. It'll pass. Were you with the Reavers in that Scoia'tael ambush? GERALT: Were you on patrol with the Reavers when they ran into those Scoia'tael? NEWBOY: Aye. GERALT: Kennet mentioned the unit was especially vicious. Notice anything out of the ordinary? A unit emblem or something? NEWBOY: Right you are. They had masks made of the cloth of Special Forces uniforms... And they hollered a lot - 'Iorveth' or some such. GERALT: Mhm. Where did the dragon come from? NEWBOY: I've no idea, but it saved our arses. The elves ceased shooting at the sight of it... Can't tell you anymore, as we fled right then as if the devil himself was on our tail. NEWBOY: Take this. Kennet told me to study up, but I've not the mind for it. Just not cut out to be a dragon hunter, I guess. It could be useful to you, though. [Newboy gives Geralt the book \"About Dragons\".] See you. [EXIT] GERALT: I need to go. NEWBOY: There are sentries on the dike - no way you'll slip through. GERALT: Can you distract them? NEWBOY: Um, I'll try. But remember: count me out if there's a fight... In fact, we could end up foes. GERALT: I hope not. Go. NEWBOY: Just give me a minute. [Geralt makes his way down to the river boat where Roche and Triss await.] [If Aryan La Valette was alive] ROCHE: Bloody hell, you didn't have to torch the castle... [If any guards were killed] ROCHE: You were to sneak out, avoid anything resembling a blood bath. GERALT: You left me the key to my manacles, not an invisibility cloak. [If no guards were killed] ROCHE: Peace and quiet - I'm impressed. The boys were betting you'd turn the dungeon into another Blaviken. GERALT: Can we sail? That peace and quiet might disappear irretrievably at any moment. GERALT: Triss, is everything all right? TRISS: Not exactly. I'm no longer the royal adviser... I've lost my post, my home in Vizima... Witcher's mistress, they call me... Kingslayer's whore... Politics can be brutal... GERALT: Triss, you put yourself out there... [If Geralt killed the executioner: Aryan alive] GERALT: I ran into a hangman torturing Aryan La Valette, trying to force him to confess to incestuous relations with his mother. Foltest's children were to be Aryan's. TRISS: Sons of bitches. GERALT: The hangman has hanged his last. [If Geralt killed the executioner: Aryan dead] GERALT: I ran into a hangman torturing Louisa La Valette, trying to force her to confess to incestuous relations with her son. Foltest's children were to be Aryan's. TRISS: Sons of bitches. GERALT: The hangman has hanged his last, but Shilard has the baroness and her children. We'll clear our names. GERALT: People say what they think they have to. TRISS: I know, but... GERALT: They'll change their minds as soon as we find the kingslayer. Roche'll see to that. Right, spy? ROCHE: I'm no spy, but you're mostly correct. ROCHE: An interregnum is chaos by definition. Rats like Baron Kimbolt and Count Maravel rule Temeria now, or strive to. But no one save old Natalis can restore true order... TRISS: Natalis is far away and of low birth. The crown's simply out of his reach. Baron Kimbolt on the other hand.... GERALT: Politics is secondary right now... Vernon, learn anything new about the kingslayer? ROCHE: A week ago, I got a message from an informer in Flotsam. He saw Iorveth in the company of a large, bald man, not unlike the one you described. GERALT: A week ago? Sounds like a cold trail to me. ROCHE: We need to start somewhere. The trading post is a few days up river, in the forests that lie on the Aedirnian border. Iorveth's territory. GERALT: Flotsam it is, then. GERALT: Triss. TRISS: Yes? GERALT: I'm a bit beat up. Will you look at my wounds? TRISS: Mhm... GERALT: Let's go below deck. And I need you to tell me about Yennefer, in detail. I want to hear it all, even the things you don't want to tell me, even the things that might hurt. ROCHE: Prepare to cast off! Clear the lines and all aboard! VES: Lines clear, captain! [If Aryan died: Character ending animatic cutscene plays. &nbsp; NARRATOR: War is a good time to forge friendships, alliances. Aryan La Valette, busy building walls and forging swords, forgot that. When he was gone, those he loved were forced to forge friendships with those he hated. &nbsp; If Aryan lived: Character ending animatic cutscene plays. &nbsp; NARRATOR: Honor's a curious thing. Honor made Aryan fight a mismatched battle against the might of Temeria. Facing defeat, honor told Aryan to bow his neck to save his men. But that same honor prevented him from saving himself.] [DANDELION, NARRATING: Life can't be easy for anyone who's labeled a regicide. That goes triple for Geralt. Could his luck get any worse?! I've known the witcher for long and I'm sure kings, courts and politics concern him as much as last year's snow.&nbsp; But, hey! Life doesn't always go as planned, right? Sometimes it even forces us to associate with unsavory characters like Vernon Roche... No, I'm not making excuses. I had my reasons. &nbsp; The witcher spent most of the way to Flotsam talking to someone. Long into the evening, as water lapped against the boat's side, Triss told him stories of his Unexpected Child and his toxic relationship with a sorceress named Yennefer. Stories of a life stolen from him. &nbsp; Am I boring you? &nbsp; Don't set this tale aside. Give me just a few more minutes. Someone special's about to appear... in dire straits, upon a scaffold.] ",

Not much left for me here... Let's just see who he was. GERALT: Necrophages'll likely come for the corpse. I should get to the village before sundown. [Geralt loots the corpse, discovering the person was invited to a tournament, and moves on up the path. In front of a hut he comes to an injured man.] . KNIGHT: *Akough hack hrrr... Ahouck he hah* . KNIGHT: Who are you? . GERALT: I'm not gonna hurt you. Will you let me look at your wounds? . KNIGHT: Odd, you don't resemble a traveling preacher... KNIGHT: Damn the dogs, it hurts to talk... I wager my armor's the only thing keeping me in one piece... GERALT: I'll find some help. KNIGHT: Futile, I'm afraid. Around here, folk don't open their doors to strangers. You would do well to find my squire. I'd like to thrash his hide for fleeing from those corpse-eaters - consider it my final wish. GERALT: I found his body by the river. GERALT: Listen, let me brew you a health potion. You're no witcher, so it could kill you, but if I'm not mistaken, you already think you're dead. There's a slim chance that your body will quell the toxins and regenerate. KNIGHT: I'll expire in this hole before I let someone turn me into a mutant. GERALT: That's not how it works. Stay calm and lie still. I need to find some herbs. [Geralt collects the necessary herbs and brews a Healing Brew.] . GERALT: Knock back this potion. Try not to vomit. GERALT: Drink it. KNIGHT: Ugh! . GERALT: You're still alive, so that bodes well. But you've got a ways to go before you're at full health. Now, you have to sit and wait. You're no mutant, so it'll be a couple of days before you recover and we can get you out of here. KNIGHT: Thank you, witcher. Ugh, Hallowed Kreve... GERALT: Didn't have the chance earlier... I'm Geralt of Rivia. KNIGHT: Bolton of Ironford. What happened here? BOLTON: I wanted to try my luck in the arena, but some corpse-eaters surprised me. My horse reared, and I came crashing down in full armor. They pounced upon me with their claws. Though broken, I managed to drive them off and crawl here... Pitiful story, but there it is. GERALT: Hm, that could mean some paid work for me. BOLTON: Doubtful. If the corpses weren't eaten, they would rot, emit a stench and breed pestilence... Ugh, damn the dogs... BOLTON: Those who fall in the arena - their bodies are cast into the ravine. The dead offer little in terms of diversion, I'm afraid, except perhaps to monsters. Get well. I've gotta go. [EXIT] GERALT: Get well, Bolton of Ironford. And farewell. BOLTON: You must take my invitation. If but half of what I've heard about witchers is true, you ought to manage well in the arena. GERALT: Thanks, Bolton. BOLTON: I thank you. And now, Geralt of Rivia, if you've no objection, I would finally like to get some sleep. [Geralt continues down the path to the gate of a town.] . GATEKEEPER: Who stalks the night? Begone, cursed soul, or I'll stick the hounds on you! GERALT: Got corpse-eaters on this side, so I'll take your hounds any day. GATEKEEPER: A jester, eh? You're all jesters, you all think you're droll, till you enter the arena. No room for jokin' around in there. GERALT: I'm not trying to be funny. I'm soaked and I'm freezing. Let me in. GATEKEEPER: Ah-hah! A vampyre. I'll not let a bloodsucker in, oh no! I've got eels in garlic here. What do you say to that? GERALT: I'll gladly submit to the eels in garlic trial. And the running water trial. And the beer trial... GATEKEEPER: Who knows what you are. Evil crawls the night, corrupting the righteous. I'll wait for morn, for the cock to crow. If the rising sun don't scare you off, I'll let you in. GERALT: You want me to wait here? GERALT: You there! GERALT: All right. Let's find a place to rest. [Attempting to talk to the Gatekeeper again before dawn yields one of the following lines.] . GATEKEEPER: Begone, 'fore I drive a stake through you! GATEKEEPER: Wait for the cock to crow, I said. GATEKEEPER: A restless soul you are. Go to sleep... damned fool. GATEKEEPER: The sun has yet to rise. GATEKEEPER: Back to bed. Or your coffin... [Geralt meditates until dawn.] . GATEKEEPER: Still there, foul soul? GERALT: Yeah, I'm still here - and the cock has crowed. As far as being foul, well, I may smell a bit... GATEKEEPER: Has it got an invitation? GERALT: It has. GATEKEEPER: Then it may enter. Good luck to it in the arena. [Geralt enters the arena and fights a variety of foes. After he exits the arena, the difficulty of the game is determined and the game starts.] . ",
