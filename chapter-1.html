   <p><span class="tag">IORVETH:</span> What do you mean, witcher?

           Helpless, yet masking that with acts of increasing cruelty.
   <p><span class="tag">IORVETH:</span> I helped kill Roche's king. You call that helpless? Or would you
           call me a terrorist? No one will grant us our freedom, witcher. We

<div class="dialogue"><p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> Listen very carefully - I'm not repeating this. We have two targets.
        The first is a Kaedweni spy - Arnolt Malliger. I want him alive.
<p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> The other is Bernard Loredo, the trading post's commander and a traitor
        to Temeria. We don't let his kind live.
<p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> Arnolt almost never leaves the residence, so we need to strike there. To
        get inside, we'll use Ves' unusual talents, and Bernard's habits.
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Stop calling him by his first name. It really rubs me the wrong way.
<p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> Whatever you wish.
<p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> Loredo's house - the first floor contains guest quarters. Geralt had
        the opportunity to take a look. Regular patrols. Second floor...
        Loredo's bodyguards' quarters. They think they're the toughest
        warriors this side of the Yaruga, but really they're lame drowners
        dressed in colorful gambesons.
<p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> Third floor, the lion's den. Here, Loredo stores plundered valuables.
        It's where he sleeps, shits and wanks off while staring at the
        statuette of a she-elf. Only the following are allowed to enter:
        Arnolt Malliger, Loredo's mother, his cousin and... whores.
<p><span class="tag">VES:</span> Ha. I'm not sure I still have that frock...
<p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> After making his round of the trading post, Loredo always orders two
        ladies. Ves will act as one of them. The house is a bloody fortress,
        but Loredo had it enlarged. The witcher will enter through the
        extension. Ves will open a window for you.
<p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> Once in you'll have to improvise, Geralt, but you'll have the element of
        surprise. Ves can hold her own too.
<p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> Zenin and Ryckard will provide cover from vantage points. If things get
        hot, lure those whoresons near the windows. I'll be in the courtyard
        with the rest, ready to enter in the extreme. I repeat, in the extreme.

        guessed something was gonna happen... Before they took her she
        whispered, "Window in the extension." When that bastard went to take
        a pee, I noticed you climbing over the wall.
