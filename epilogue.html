[Geralt experiences a flashback.
   <br>NARRATOR: The winter solstice, 1270. Midinvaerne – the night of magic.
   <div class="narbreak">&nbsp;</div>
   Letho wasn't lying - the Hunt had stopped. At the Hanged Man’s Tree, the spectral riders selected from among those they had taken. Yennefer was among them...
   <div class="narbreak">&nbsp;</div>
   A wraith cannot be killed, only driven away. Every witcher knows that. Yet the riders fell beneath the blows of our witchers’ blades, crimson blood flowed from under their dead men’s armor. We could not kill them all - they were simply too many. A stalemate.
   <div class="narbreak">&nbsp;</div>
   He was different from all other elves. There was no shame in his gaze. He had never suffered persecution, he had endured no massacres, humans had not taken his land. This elf was not of this world. He was an invader.
   <div class="narbreak">&nbsp;</div>
   We struck a deal. My soul for that of Yennefer. He agreed without hesitation.]

<div class="dialogue">
<p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> Back with me, friend? Got the feeling you left for a minute...
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Memories... I remember the Hanged Man's Tree and the Wild Hunt. I

      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> I knew you wouldn't give up, I knew you'd pursue me. And I don't
              aim to hide anymore. Fact is, only you know the truth about me -
              well, and a couple of folks whose word isn't worth spit anymore.
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> I never saw you as a foe. I want to go my way, but if I have to
              fight you first, so be it. This story ends here and now.</div>

      <div class="choice"><span>Yennefer - tell me what happened to her.
      </span></div>
      <div class="dialogue">
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Tell me about Yennefer. What happened after I... departed?
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> She was feverish for several days, delirious, in agony. We thought
              that was it - she was on her way out. Somehow she recovered, but
              even then she was disoriented. Amnesia, like you.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> What then?
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> Well, the woman turned out to be quite a character. Throwing
              temper tantrums, trying to seduce Auckes, trying to drive a wedge
              between us. After you so nobly sacrificed yourself, we thought
              it'd be dumb just to leave her somewhere. She wouldn't've
              survived more than a month. The whims and vigor of a duchess,
              but she was just a sorceress with no memory...
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> We were in the heart of the Empire, and as I'm sure you know,
              Geralt, in Nilfgaard mages who behave like that either drop their
              bad habits quickly or are drawn and quartered by horses in the
              middle of Victory Square.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> So I heard.
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> So we set out, wandered through the provinces. Everywhere we went,
              she got in trouble and we pulled her out. And then one day they
              captured us - the Imperial secret police. Me, Auckes, Serrit and
              Yennefer.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Imperial secret police?
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> Mhm. We were separated, and they questioned us. Long and
              thoroughly, but it was uneventful, no violence.
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> That's how I met Vattier de Ridaux, and a couple of weeks later,
              the Emperor himself. Me - a simple witcher.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> What happened to Yennefer?
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> I dunno. Never saw her again. The Emperor offered me a mission in
              the Northern Kingdoms. As for Yennefer, I had the feeling she was
              somehow important to Emhyr. As I see it, they learned of the
              Lodge from her. Those Imperial spooks have their ways. All I
              heard is that Vattier had his men watch Yennefer closely
              throughout the time she was at the palace. Then we went off to
              slay the kings of the North, and that's where my knowledge ends.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> So she's in the Empire.
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> She was when I left.

      <div class="choice"><span>Why did you become an imperial spy?
      </span></div>
      <div class="dialogue">
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> How did a witcher agree to kill humans at another human's bidding?
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> At the Emperor's bidding, Geralt. And he's no ordinary human. The
              rulers of the North come up to about where his poleyns end.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Why?
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> Simple - he promised to rebuild the School of the Viper, the
              witchers' order where I came to be. Witchers' schools in the
              south fell into ruin long ago, and witchers themselves became
              internal exiles, banned from entering most cities.
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> Besides Serrit and Auckes, I know of two other witchers of the
              School of the Viper who should be alive and on the Path. I don't
              know where they are, haven't seen them for years. Now, they can
              come out of hiding, they can come home.
      </div>

      <div class="choice"><span>What was it all about? What was the aim?
      </span></div>
      <div class="dialogue">
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Care to tell me what it was all about?
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> Hm. Kill as many rulers as we could. Lay the blame on the
              sorceresses. Breed chaos. Prepare the North, soften it before the
              invasion.
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> And you know what's incredible? We could not have imagined more
              fertile soil. No matter what the war's outcome, the Northern
              monarchs'll accuse one another, pursue their god-given rights,
              seek vengeance and be at each others' throats for years to come.

      </span></div>
      <div class="dialogue">
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Where'd you get your information about the Lodge?
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> From the Emperor and Vattier de Ridaux, the emperor's chief spy.
              And I believe they got it out of Yennefer.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> She recovered her memory?
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> Nah, I'd never claim she informed on her friends consciously. I
              expect they found a way to tap into her memory in spite of her
              amnesia and without her knowing it. There was a sorcerer present
              when I was questioned. A young, proud intelligence officer.
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> Whatever the case, they gave me a list of the sorceresses in the
              Lodge. Only Emhyr, Vattier and I were present. Only we knew of
              the mission.
      </div>

      <div class="choice"><span>How did you find Síle?
     </span></div>
     <div class="dialogue">
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> How did you manage to contact Síle?
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> It wasn't a problem once I learned of the Lodge's existence.
              Initially, she watched my every move. But sooner or later,
              everyone starts treating me like a big oaf. I mean, I can't
              change how I look.
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> I stayed close to Síle, killed a few beasts for her, and whined
              about how unhappy I was, how unfair the world was - so much, in
              fact, that I actually got her gander up a few times.
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> I made sure a few potentially trustworthy witnesses saw us
              together, could link us... Security, in case I was captured. I
              also prepared to assassinate the king of Kovir. Esterad Thyssen
              was to be the first victim of the mysterious assassins.
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> But before I could do the dirty deed, Síle asked me to slay
              Demavend. The gods had smiled upon me. I couldn't believe my
              luck. Here I'd been trying to figure out how to frame Síle, and
              now all I needed was to carry out her orders and follow through.
      </div>

      <div class="choice"><span>How did you kill Demavend?
     </span></div>
     <div class="dialogue">
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> How'd you manage to slay Demavend?
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> Síle's magic. I mean she could give us the king's every move, his
              habits, the positions of the palace guards, anything. All we had
              to do was navigate the labyrinth and land the final blow.
              Besides, she had plenty of gold for the preparations, greased
              palms abundantly. It had all the makings of a cakewalk, but it's
              never that easy.
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> We barely avoided our pursuers. And we wouldn't have if not for
              Iorveth's Scoia'tael - another of Síle's ideas. With Iorveth's
              elves, not only did we cut down Demavend, but traveling with them
              put us out of the Lodge's reach. We could calmly plan Foltest's
              and Henselt's assassinations.
              </div>

      <div class="choice"><span>How did you know Foltest would get to the solar?
      </span></div>
      <div class="dialogue">
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> How did you know Foltest would come to the monastery's solar?
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> Iorveth and I planned Foltest's murder. The King of Temeria would
              have to deal with the La Valettes sooner or later, and he made no
              secret of it. I was sure he'd want to recover his bastard
              children in the process. And where do they take the children when
              a castle's under siege?
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> I had to become a monk. But I couldn't just arrive at the
              monastery and claim I'd seen the light. Not very believable...
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> So, one of Aryan's patrols, out in the forests, happened on a
              Scoia'tael unit torturing a helpless monk. Aryan's brave men
              drove off the elves, and I found shelter in the monastery.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> No one noticed you had no wounds?
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> I paid the monk who treated me a lot of orens to stay silent.
              Actually, it was only a loan, 'cause I killed him later. Only the
              dead can keep a secret.
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> Then all I had to do was wait for the situation to develop. When I
              saw you enter the chamber with Foltest, I thought I might fail...
              Luckily, you failed - to recognize an old friend...

         <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> By that time, his death was no longer necessary. Fate had smiled
                 upon us again. I learned of the summit and the efforts to

      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> There are a lot of legends and myths about it, but the Wild Hunt
              is a fact. I've fought and killed many of its wraiths. They were
              spectral emanations, the avatars of real riders... The riders we
              ran into by the Hanged Man's Tree.
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> Are you telling me you were carried off by elves? Real, material
              sons of bitches, like the ordinary kind we deal with in this
              world?
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> They may be ordinary in their world, but they're strangers in
              ours. The Conjunction of Spheres - know the theory? Do you know
              how monsters appeared in our world?
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> There's not a witcher who doesn't know that.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> So you know there are other Spheres. The most powerful of our
              mages can open passages between these worlds, and they usually do
              that to summon the monsters we then have to hunt.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> The elves we saw come from another world. And they weren't
              summoned, they found the way on their own. It's not exactly easy,
              so they usually send their spectral emanations. They come in
              person on special missions.
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> As they did for you and Yennefer.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Mhm.
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> So, elves from another world and their trained wraiths... What did
              they want from you?

[DANDELION, NARRATING: The witcher had traveled far and wide in search of the
   kingslayers. In Flotsam, he slew Bernard Loredo, but few mourned for the
   commandant. Flotsam remained Temerian, while command of the garrison and
   town went to a Viziman noble - a sworn enemy of Kaedwen and an avid angler.
   To this day folk gather round bonfires in Lobinden to hear of the witcher's
   deeds.
<div class="narbreak">&nbsp;</div>
   The witcher witnessed a great Kaedweni victory in Aedirn. At Vergen,
   Henselt's army crushed Saskia the Dragonslayer's motley force, ending the
   springtime of races. Soldiers of the Unicorn swarmed over the Pontar Valley.
   As it had before, powerful Kaedwen swallowed Upper Aedirn whole. Yet
   subsequent events would render Henselt's triumph short-lived.
<div class="narbreak">&nbsp;</div>
   <span style="font-weight:500">[If Geralt rescued Triss]</span> After Foltest's death, Temeria's neighbors began to vie for the glittering prize that was the realm's throne. Yet the murders of first Demavend, then Henselt, forced them to look to their own problems. Temeria fell prey to its power-hungry barons. But Vernon Roche held a light of hope for the dying realm and he tucked it away in a place safe and still to await better times.
<div class="narbreak">&nbsp;</div>
   <span style="font-weight:500">[If Geralt rescued Anaïs and sent her to Radovid]</span> When King Foltest fell at the hands of an assassin, chaos engulfed his realm. Where others saw spoils, Roche saw his motherland bleeding. Vernon made a difficult choice, surrendering Foltest's daughter to Radovid. The Redanian ruler, trump card in hand, turned Temeria into his protectorate and began restoring peace. The kingdom's inhabitants soon learned why Radovid was called "The Stern."
<div class="narbreak">&nbsp;</div>
   <span style="font-weight:500">[If Geralt rescued Anaïs and sent her to Natalis]</span> With Foltest slain, Temeria's barons began to vie for the throne. Many dreamt of donning the crown, yet none could assemble the allies required to snatch it. The kingdom's last hope, as it teetered on the edge of civil war, lay in little Anaïs. Natalis was named regent and ruled the land, yet the girl was the living symbol of the realm's salvaged unity. 
<div class="narbreak">&nbsp;</div>
   <span style="font-weight:500">[If Triss intervened at the Summit]</span> Years before, Geralt of Rivia had witnessed the fall of the Council and Conclave of mages. The summit in Loc Muinne re-established both bodies... their founders sacrificing Síle de Tansarville and her accomplices. Yet Radovid also required humility and loyalty from the proud mages. But this did not sit well with all of them. 
<div class="narbreak">&nbsp;</div>
   <span style="font-weight:500">[If Triss was not at the Summit]</span> A tempest descended upon the North - at least partly the work of manipulative mages. It seemed the turmoil in Temeria, Aedirn, and Kaedwen would benefit them most. Common folk turned against sorceresses and all "magic freaks," witchers included. Castles that had hitherto welcomed mavens of the magical arts now shut their gates to any who sought shelter there. A witch hunt ensued. 
<div class="narbreak">&nbsp;</div>
   It was a time of great uncertainty, of rape accomplished by royal decree.
   Yet as troubled as the days seemed, we who had in some way shaped the
   world's fate finally received some respite. Zoltan resumed the quest for his
   beloved's hand, and I laid my head in the laps of the muses. Who could have
   known this tempest which had ravaged the North was but a harbinger of darker
   days? And the preamble to an entirely new tale of Geralt of Rivia.]</div>
