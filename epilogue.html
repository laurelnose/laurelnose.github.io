<p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> Mhm. My final prank... I switched the diamonds. The one in the
        megascope has a flaw - minute, but just large enough to warp the
        teleport. The Emperor's magic theorists assured me the effect would be

           would not have gotten far without her.

<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Yeah. I saved your life. Couldn't think of a nicer way to pay me back?
<p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> Frankly, I couldn't. I mean, taking care of another man's woman...
        Yennefer. I can't fathom what you saw in her, but I suppose there's no
        accounting for taste...
</div>

<div class="stage">[Geralt experiences a flashback.
   <br>NARRATOR: The winter solstice, 1270. Midinvaerne – the night of magic.
   <div class="narbreak">&nbsp;</div>
   Letho wasn't lying - the Hunt had stopped. At the Hanged Man’s Tree, the spectral riders selected from among those they had taken. Yennefer was among them...
   <div class="narbreak">&nbsp;</div>
   A wraith cannot be killed, only driven away. Every witcher knows that. Yet the riders fell beneath the blows of our witchers’ blades, crimson blood flowed from under their dead men’s armor. We could not kill them all - they were simply too many. A stalemate.
   <div class="narbreak">&nbsp;</div>
   He was different from all other elves. There was no shame in his gaze. He had never suffered persecution, he had endured no massacres, humans had not taken his land. This elf was not of this world. He was an invader.
   <div class="narbreak">&nbsp;</div>
   We struck a deal. My soul for that of Yennefer. He agreed without hesitation.]</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> Back with me, friend? Got the feeling you left for a minute...
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Memories... I remember the Hanged Man's Tree and the Wild Hunt. I
        remember the exchange - me for Yennefer.
<p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> So, cards out on the table. Unless you chased me all that way just to
        kill me...
</div>

<div class="indent">
   <div class="choice"><span>I chased you for many reasons.
   </span></div>
   <div class="dialogue">
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I chased you for lots of reasons. You owe me - some explanations,
           to start with.
   <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> Let's say I do.
   </div>

   <div class="indent">
      <div class="choice"><span>Why did you wait for me?
      </span></div>
      <div class="dialogue">
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Why are you still here? Why did you wait for me this time?
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> I knew you wouldn't give up, I knew you'd pursue me. And I don't
              aim to hide anymore. Fact is, only you know the truth about me -
              well, and a couple of folks whose word isn't worth spit anymore.
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> I never saw you as a foe. I want to go my way, but if I have to
              fight you first, so be it. This story ends here and now.</div>

      <div class="choice"><span>Yennefer - tell me what happened to her.
      </span></div>
      <div class="dialogue">
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Tell me about Yennefer. What happened after I... departed?
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> She was feverish for several days, delirious, in agony. We thought
              that was it - she was on her way out. Somehow she recovered, but
              even then she was disoriented. Amnesia, like you.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> What then?
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> Well, the woman turned out to be quite a character. Throwing
              temper tantrums, trying to seduce Auckes, trying to drive a wedge
              between us. After you so nobly sacrificed yourself, we thought
              it'd be dumb just to leave her somewhere. She wouldn't've
              survived more than a month. The whims and vigor of a duchess,
              but she was just a sorceress with no memory...
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> We were in the heart of the Empire, and as I'm sure you know,
              Geralt, in Nilfgaard mages who behave like that either drop their
              bad habits quickly or are drawn and quartered by horses in the
              middle of Victory Square.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> So I heard.
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> So we set out, wandered through the provinces. Everywhere we went,
              she got in trouble and we pulled her out. And then one day they
              captured us - the Imperial secret police. Me, Auckes, Serrit and
              Yennefer.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Imperial secret police?
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> Mhm. We were separated, and they questioned us. Long and
              thoroughly, but it was uneventful, no violence.
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> That's how I met Vattier de Ridaux, and a couple of weeks later,
              the Emperor himself. Me - a simple witcher.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> What happened to Yennefer?
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> I dunno. Never saw her again. The Emperor offered me a mission in
              the Northern Kingdoms. As for Yennefer, I had the feeling she was
              somehow important to Emhyr. As I see it, they learned of the
              Lodge from her. Those Imperial spooks have their ways. All I
              heard is that Vattier had his men watch Yennefer closely
              throughout the time she was at the palace. Then we went off to
              slay the kings of the North, and that's where my knowledge ends.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> So she's in the Empire.
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> She was when I left.
      </div>

      <div class="choice"><span>Why did you become an imperial spy?
      </span></div>
      <div class="dialogue">
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> How did a witcher agree to kill humans at another human's bidding?
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> At the Emperor's bidding, Geralt. And he's no ordinary human. The
              rulers of the North come up to about where his poleyns end.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Why?
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> Simple - he promised to rebuild the School of the Viper, the
              witchers' order where I came to be. Witchers' schools in the
              south fell into ruin long ago, and witchers themselves became
              internal exiles, banned from entering most cities.
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> Besides Serrit and Auckes, I know of two other witchers of the
              School of the Viper who should be alive and on the Path. I don't
              know where they are, haven't seen them for years. Now, they can
              come out of hiding, they can come home.
      </div>

      <div class="choice"><span>What was it all about? What was the aim?
      </span></div>
      <div class="dialogue">
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Care to tell me what it was all about?
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> Hm. Kill as many rulers as we could. Lay the blame on the
              sorceresses. Breed chaos. Prepare the North, soften it before the
              invasion.
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> And you know what's incredible? We could not have imagined more
              fertile soil. No matter what the war's outcome, the Northern
              monarchs'll accuse one another, pursue their god-given rights,
              seek vengeance and be at each others' throats for years to come.
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> The North resembles a whorehouse on fire, as your friend Dandelion
              would say.
      </div>

      <div class="choice"><span>How'd you learn about the Lodge?
      </span></div>
      <div class="dialogue">
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Where'd you get your information about the Lodge?
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> From the Emperor and Vattier de Ridaux, the emperor's chief spy.
              And I believe they got it out of Yennefer.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> She recovered her memory?
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> Nah, I'd never claim she informed on her friends consciously. I
              expect they found a way to tap into her memory in spite of her
              amnesia and without her knowing it. There was a sorcerer present
              when I was questioned. A young, proud intelligence officer.
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> Whatever the case, they gave me a list of the sorceresses in the
              Lodge. Only Emhyr, Vattier and I were present. Only we knew of
              the mission.
      </div>

      <div class="choice"><span>How did you find Síle?
     </span></div>
     <div class="dialogue">
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> How did you manage to contact Síle?
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> It wasn't a problem once I learned of the Lodge's existence.
              Initially, she watched my every move. But sooner or later,
              everyone starts treating me like a big oaf. I mean, I can't
              change how I look.
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> I stayed close to Síle, killed a few beasts for her, and whined
              about how unhappy I was, how unfair the world was - so much, in
              fact, that I actually got her gander up a few times.
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> I made sure a few potentially trustworthy witnesses saw us
              together, could link us... Security, in case I was captured. I
              also prepared to assassinate the king of Kovir. Esterad Thyssen
              was to be the first victim of the mysterious assassins.
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> But before I could do the dirty deed, Síle asked me to slay
              Demavend. The gods had smiled upon me. I couldn't believe my
              luck. Here I'd been trying to figure out how to frame Síle, and
              now all I needed was to carry out her orders and follow through.
      </div>

      <div class="choice"><span>How did you kill Demavend?
     </span></div>
     <div class="dialogue">
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> How'd you manage to slay Demavend?
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> Síle's magic. I mean she could give us the king's every move, his
              habits, the positions of the palace guards, anything. All we had
              to do was navigate the labyrinth and land the final blow.
              Besides, she had plenty of gold for the preparations, greased
              palms abundantly. It had all the makings of a cakewalk, but it's
              never that easy.
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> We barely avoided our pursuers. And we wouldn't have if not for
              Iorveth's Scoia'tael - another of Síle's ideas. With Iorveth's
              elves, not only did we cut down Demavend, but traveling with them
              put us out of the Lodge's reach. We could calmly plan Foltest's
              and Henselt's assassinations.
              </div>

      <div class="choice"><span>How did you know Foltest would get to the solar?
      </span></div>
      <div class="dialogue">
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> How did you know Foltest would come to the monastery's solar?
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> Iorveth and I planned Foltest's murder. The King of Temeria would
              have to deal with the La Valettes sooner or later, and he made no
              secret of it. I was sure he'd want to recover his bastard
              children in the process. And where do they take the children when
              a castle's under siege?
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> I had to become a monk. But I couldn't just arrive at the
              monastery and claim I'd seen the light. Not very believable...
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> So, one of Aryan's patrols, out in the forests, happened on a
              Scoia'tael unit torturing a helpless monk. Aryan's brave men
              drove off the elves, and I found shelter in the monastery.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> No one noticed you had no wounds?
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> I paid the monk who treated me a lot of orens to stay silent.
              Actually, it was only a loan, 'cause I killed him later. Only the
              dead can keep a secret.
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> Then all I had to do was wait for the situation to develop. When I
              saw you enter the chamber with Foltest, I thought I might fail...
              Luckily, you failed - to recognize an old friend...
      </div>

      <div class="choice"><span>You failed to slay Henselt...

      <div class="dialogue">
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Shame you didn't take a shot at Henselt yourself. History
              might've taken a different turn.
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> Maybe I would've killed him. Maybe you would've killed me. Who
              knows. But Henselt's death, although desirable, wasn't necessary
              anymore. The plan could go forward without it.</div>

         <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> You killed Serrit and Auckes. Damn shame, as I see it. Two
                 good witchers.
         <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> They were murderers, Letho. Just like you. Don't change the
                 subject.
         <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> Right. I was on my way to Loc Muinne by that time. I had to
                 prepare, inform that prune Shilard of the plan. Everything had
                 to play out perfectly. There was no room for error.</div>

      <div class="dialogue">
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> You screwed up with Henselt.
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> Sabrina's curse tore that down. First off, we got holed up in
              that hideout in the ravines. Then Síle showed up and started
              watching Henselt like he was her own ass.
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> By that time, his death was no longer necessary. Fate had smiled
              upon us again. I learned of the summit and the efforts to
              reconstitute the Council and Conclave. The ideal setting for the
              mission's grand finale.</div>
      </div>

      </span></div>
      <div class="dialogue">
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> So Síle was looking for you when she came to Flotsam.
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> Mhm. She thought she was still in control and wanted to get rid
              of me. I'd bet my eyes that she thought I'd lost my mind, or that
              Iorveth was manipulating me.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> And the North descended deeper into chaos.
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> Exactly. There was just one problem - you. I could've killed you
              in the elven ruins. Thing is, you weren't really my enemy...</div>

      <div class="choice"><span>You wanted to take over Iorveth's unit - what was the idea?
      </span></div>
      <div class="dialogue">
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> When did you decide to get rid of Iorveth?
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> As soon as I realized I couldn't manipulate him. A true fox, that
              one. He was so observant, so dangerous. I got the sense he might
              see through me at any moment.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> You made a mistake. You were untouchable as long as the
              Scoia'tael were protecting you.
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> Maybe, but with Iorveth, my hands were tied. If I'd finished off
              Ciaran...
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> But you didn't, and that allowed me to drive a wedge between you
              and Iorveth. I forced you to flee.
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> And I let you live. You know I could've killed you. You're
              forgetting...
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> No, I remember.</div>

      <div class="choice"><span>The riders of the Hunt - you know who they are?
      </span></div>
      <div class="dialogue">
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> How did you know where we'd find the Wild Hunt?
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> Every witcher who wears the viper around his neck knows the place.
              We had so many books and scrolls about the Hunt that I used to
              think our school was founded for the very purpose of solving the
              riddle of the spectral riders.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Know who they are? You know the true identities of the riders?
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> From what I understand, they're some damn elven race. But they
              turned out to be a big ruse. The legendary omen of war proved to
              be a fairground attraction...
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> No market square mage could possibly conjure up a cavalcade of
              wraiths speeding across the sky. Then there's the amnesia. No,
              they're something more, I assure you.
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> Go ahead, enlighten me. I can tell you want to.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> There are a lot of legends and myths about it, but the Wild Hunt
              is a fact. I've fought and killed many of its wraiths. They were
              spectral emanations, the avatars of real riders... The riders we
              ran into by the Hanged Man's Tree.
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> Are you telling me you were carried off by elves? Real, material
              sons of bitches, like the ordinary kind we deal with in this
              world?
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> They may be ordinary in their world, but they're strangers in
              ours. The Conjunction of Spheres - know the theory? Do you know
              how monsters appeared in our world?
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> There's not a witcher who doesn't know that.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> So you know there are other Spheres. The most powerful of our
              mages can open passages between these worlds, and they usually do
              that to summon the monsters we then have to hunt.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> The elves we saw come from another world. And they weren't
              summoned, they found the way on their own. It's not exactly easy,
              so they usually send their spectral emanations. They come in
              person on special missions.
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> As they did for you and Yennefer.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Mhm.
      <p><span class="tag">LETHO:</span> So, elves from another world and their trained wraiths... What did
              they want from you?
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I've got an idea, but that's not your concern.</div>

   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> You're a fool, Letho. Both you and your emperor are forgetting one
           thing... Misfortune brings people together. Very shortly, the North
           could be united like never before. Thanks to you... But that's just
           not my concern anymore...
