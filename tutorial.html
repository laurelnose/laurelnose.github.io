<p class=dialogue><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Damned leaky boat. My boots are soaked. Yet another boggy shithole.</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Attacked by necrophages. Not much left for me here... Let's just see who
        he was.</p>
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Necrophages'll likely come for the corpse. I should get to the village
        before sundown.</p>

<p class="stage">[Geralt loots the corpse, discovering the person was invited to a tournament,
    and moves on up the path. In front of a hut he comes to an injured man.]</p>

<p><span class="tag">KNIGHT:</span> *Akough hack hrrr... Ahouck he hah*</p>
<p><span class="tag">KNIGHT:</span> Who are you?</p>
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I'm not gonna hurt you. Will you let me look at your wounds?</p>
<P><span class="tag">KNIGHT:</span> Odd, you don't resemble a traveling preacher...</p>
<P><span class="tag">KNIGHT:</span> Damn the dogs, it hurts to talk... I wager my armor's the only thing
        keeping me in one piece...</p>
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I'll find some help.</p>
<p><span class="tag">KNIGHT:</span> Futile, I'm afraid. Around here, folk don't open their doors to
        strangers. You would do well to find my squire. I'd like to thrash his
        hide for fleeing from those corpse-eaters - consider it my final wish.</p>
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I found his body by the river.</p>
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Listen, let me brew you a health potion. You're no witcher, so it could
        kill you, but if I'm not mistaken, you already think you're dead.
        There's a slim chance that your body will quell the toxins and
        regenerate.<p>
<p><span class="tag">KNIGHT:</span> I'll expire in this hole before I let someone turn me into a mutant.</p>
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> That's not how it works. Stay calm and lie still. I need to find some
        herbs.</p>
</div>

<p class="stage">[Geralt collects the necessary herbs and brews a Healing Brew.]</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Knock back this potion. Try not to vomit.</p>
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Drink it.</p>
<p><span class="tag">KNIGHT:</span> Ugh!</p>
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> You're still alive, so that bodes well. But you've got a ways to go
        before you're at full health. Now, you have to sit and wait. You're no
        mutant, so it'll be a couple of days before you recover and we can get
        you out of here.</p>
<p><span class="tag">KNIGHT:</span> Thank you, witcher. Ugh, Hallowed Kreve...</p>
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Didn't have the chance earlier... I'm Geralt of Rivia.</p>

   <div class="dialogue">
   <p><span class="tag">BOLTON:</span> I wanted to try my luck in the arena, but some corpse-eaters
           surprised me. My horse reared, and I came crashing down in full
           armor. They pounced upon me with their claws. Though broken, I
           managed to drive them off and crawl here... Pitiful story, but there
           it is.</p>
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Hm, that could mean some paid work for me.</p>
   <p><span class="tag">BOLTON:</span> Doubtful. If the corpses weren't eaten, they would rot, emit a
           stench and breed pestilence... Ugh, damn the dogs...</p>
   <p><span class="tag">BOLTON:</span> Those who fall in the arena - their bodies are cast into the ravine.
           The dead offer little in terms of diversion, I'm afraid, except
           perhaps to monsters.</p>
   </div>

   <div class="choice"><span>Get well. I've gotta go. [EXIT]</span></div>
   <div class="dialogue">
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Get well, Bolton of Ironford. And farewell.</p>
   <p><span class="tag">BOLTON:</span> You must take my invitation. If but half of what I've heard about
           witchers is true, you ought to manage well in the arena.</p>
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Thanks, Bolton.</p>
   <p><span class="tag">BOLTON:</span> I thank you. And now, Geralt of Rivia, if you've no objection, I
           would finally like to get some sleep.</p>

<p><span class="tag">GATEKEEPER:</span> Who stalks the night? Begone, cursed soul, or I'll stick the hounds
        on you!
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Got corpse-eaters on this side, so I'll take your hounds any day.
<p><span class="tag">GATEKEEPER:</span> A jester, eh? You're all jesters, you all think you're droll, till
        you enter the arena. No room for jokin' around in there.
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I'm not trying to be funny. I'm soaked and I'm freezing. Let me in.
<p><span class="tag">GATEKEEPER:</span> Ah-hah! A vampyre. I'll not let a bloodsucker in, oh no! I've got
        eels in garlic here. What do you say to that?
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I'll gladly submit to the eels in garlic trial. And the running water
        trial. And the beer trial...
<p><span class="tag">GATEKEEPER:</span> Who knows what you are. Evil crawls the night, corrupting the
        righteous. I'll wait for morn, for the cock to crow. If the rising sun
        don't scare you off, I'll let you in.
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> You want me to wait here?
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> You there!
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> All right. Let's find a place to rest.

<p><span class="tag">GATEKEEPER:</span> Begone, 'fore I drive a stake through you!
<p><span class="tag">GATEKEEPER:</span> Wait for the cock to crow, I said.
<p><span class="tag">GATEKEEPER:</span> A restless soul you are. Go to sleep... damned fool.
<p><span class="tag">GATEKEEPER:</span> The sun has yet to rise.
<p><span class="tag">GATEKEEPER:</span> Back to bed. Or your coffin...

<div class="dialogue">
<p><span class="tag">GATEKEEPER:</span> Still there, foul soul?
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Yeah, I'm still here - and the cock has crowed. As far as being foul,
        well, I may smell a bit...
<p><span class="tag">GATEKEEPER:</span> Has it got an invitation?
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> It has.
<p><span class="tag">GATEKEEPER:</span> Then it may enter. Good luck to it in the arena.
