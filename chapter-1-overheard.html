## BLACKSMITH
[Geralt may overhear this at Berthold Candeleria's workshop.]

BERTHOLD: My prices stay as they are. And I'll not join your guild. Period.
BLACKMAILER: I urge you to reconsider.
BERTHOLD: I don't give a shit about your guild - I'll not join that racket nor
        change my prices. My weapons are superior, and that's how I aim to
        keep it.
BLACKMAILER: Shame. Please think it over. The guild helps and protects. And
        accidents do happen.
BLACKMAILER: Fires are common enough in smithies. And a broken arm can make it
        very difficult to forge weapons...
BERTHOLD: You threatening me, dipshit?! Piss off! And don't come back, or I'll
        thrash you so hard even your ploughing guild won't help you!
