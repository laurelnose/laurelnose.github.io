<p><span class="tag">SOLDIER 1:</span> What's in the pot today?
<p><span class="tag">COOK:</span> Same as yesterday.
<p><span class="tag">SOLDIER 2:</span> Same slop as always? Bloody hell.
<p><span class="tag">COOK:</span> Don't eat it.
<p><span class="tag">SOLDIER 1:</span> Watch it, grease-burner, or you'll end up in the soup.
<p><span class="tag">COOK:</span> I cook what I'm given. Can't help it.
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<p><span class="tag">SOLDIER 1:</span> Goat stew today!
<p><span class="tag">COOK:</span> Not quite.
<p><span class="tag">SOLDIER 2:</span> Why the hell not?! My gut's been rumbling since morning. Been thinking of it all day!
<p><span class="tag">COOK:</span> Goat wandered off last night.
<p><span class="tag">SOLDIER 1:</span> Wandered off to the knights, I'll wager. Roastin' over the fire somewhere by now.
<p><span class="tag">SOLDIER 2:</span> Stuffing themselves at our expense. So, what do we get?
<p><span class="tag">COOK:</span> Porridge.
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<p><span class="tag">SOLDIER:</span> Ah, the aroma...
<p><span class="tag">COOK:</span> Told you I can cook. As long as I get the supplies.
<p><span class="tag">SOLDIER:</span> Hm... Where'd they get the meat from?
<p><span class="tag">COOK:</span> Dunno, don't care. Might very well be the lads that fell yesterday.
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<p><span class="tag">SOLDIER 1:</span> Anything to drink?
<p><span class="tag">COOK:</span> Wine.
<p><span class="tag">SOLDIER 2:</span> You're daft...!
<p><span class="tag">COOK:</span> No. You deaf? Wine.
<p><span class="tag">SOLDIER 1:</span> Hear that? We're getting wine!
<p><span class="tag">SOLDIER 2:</span> Wouldn't rejoice if I were you. Foltest hands out wine before an assault. Thinks his men'll grow unnaturally large bollocks.
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<p><span class="tag">SOLDIER 1:</span> Porridge. With pork cracklings.
<p><span class="tag">SOLDIER 2:</span> Ah, my mother used to make porridge... Never had better in me life.
<p><span class="tag">SOLDIER 1:</span> Cook's certainly won't top your mother's.
<p><span class="tag">SOLDIER 2:</span> What's in the pot, cook?
<p><span class="tag">COOK:</span> Turnips.
<p><span class="tag">SOLDIER 1:</span> Crawl under a rock and die.
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<p><span class="tag">SOLDIER 1:</span> You heard...? After your stew yesterday, half of seventh company had the runs.
<p><span class="tag">COOK:</span> Didn't hear it.
<p><span class="tag">SOLDIER 2:</span> Now you bloody well have. If it ever happens again, I'll slaughter and cook you meself. Except who'd eat that carcass? Better off usin' you to fatten the pigs.

<p><span class="tag">SERGEANT:</span> Soldiers! Today we enter the fray! An assault! Remember this - a soldier with no balls will likely lose his head!

<div class="dialogue">
<p><span class="tag">SERGEANT:</span> I said attention, imbecile! Where are you from, flunkey?!
<p><span class="tag">SOLDIER:</span> Murky Waters, Sergeant!

<p><span class="tag">SOLDIER:</span> Yes, sir! Sergeant, sir!
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<p><span class="tag">SERGEANT:</span> Now, listen up! We'll soon be joining the fray, and I must say I've never seen a lovelier war! While the knights battle it out on the walls, we head straight for the town.
<p><span class="tag">SOLDIER:</span> But Sergeant, there's a river in the way!
<p><span class="tag">SERGEANT:</span> The very reason we've spent the last week nailing together rafts and stealing - ahem - that is, commandeering fishing boats. We shall cross the river to the town in those very boats. As planned by His Majesty, King Foltest. What say you to that, flunkeys?

<p><span class="tag">SOLDIER 2:</span> I know him. He's tough. He'll bounce back, you'll see, and kill many a La Valette.
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<p><span class="tag">SOLDIER 1:</span> Seen what they did to Jasper?
<p><span class="tag">SOLDIER 2:</span> The way I see it, he'll never walk again.

<p><span class="tag">SOLDIER 2:</span> Hm. He'd be better off dead, the veggie.

<div class="dialogue">
<p><span class="tag">SOLDIER 1:</span> Bloody hell, he was a good lad.
<p><span class="tag">SOLDIER 2:</span> Shut it. He's still alive.

</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<p><span class="tag">SOLDIER 1:</span> Look at that whoreson. He's all set.
<p><span class="tag">SOLDIER 2:</span> How so?
<p><span class="tag">SOLDIER 1:</span> While we're charging at the La Valettes' pikes, he'll be lying here, safe and sound.
<p><span class="tag">SOLDIER 2:</span> He's wounded.
<p><span class="tag">SOLDIER 1:</span> Wounded? He may be squealing like a pig to the slaughter, but that's barely a scratch on his foot.
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<p><span class="tag">SOLDIER 1:</span> D'you see him get hit?
<p><span class="tag">SOLDIER 2:</span> I was there when it happened.

<p><span class="tag">SOLDIER 2:</span> Bloody fucking high-borns. Time to finish 'em off. Once and for all.
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<p><span class="tag">SOLDIER 1:</span> That quack's to operate on Banquo.
<p><span class="tag">SOLDIER 2:</span> Hope he don't sew his dick to his forehead.
<p><span class="tag">SOLDIER 1:</span> Did he get hit in the dick?
<p><span class="tag">SOLDIER 2:</span> Yeah. They cut him up like a pig. He'd be better off dead and buried than under the quack's knife.
<p><span class="tag">SOLDIER 1:</span> Bloody hell. Had to send us a butcher instead of a medic.
