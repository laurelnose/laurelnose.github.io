        Pontar Valley. Bondar, famous for having the most beautiful whores
        in the North, and Flotsam, for having the best fist fighting scene.
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Who organizes these fights?
<p><span class="tag">ZIGGY:</span> Officially, no one. But look hard, and you'll be surprised what you can
        find. It's a vibrant scene with winners and losers of all kinds. I
        promote fighters, place them in tournaments. Singled you out and
        venture to say you'll not regret that.
<p><span class="tag">ZIGGY:</span> Now, let's go where boys become men and brawlers become champions. The

<p><span class="tag">GRIDLEY:</span> S–story?
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> There's always a story, Gridley. Spit it out.
<p><span class="tag">GRIDLEY:</span> *Sigh* We're former soldiers, fought for Aedirn during one of the wars
        with Nilfgaard – times long past. I was Rupert's adjutant in the field
        hospital that our unit set up in this manor house. We didn't at all
        mind who lived here. In fact, the inmates were friendly... At the
        outset, that is.
<p><span class="tag">GRIDLEY:</span> One day our scouts captured a Nilfgaardian. He was desperate to win
        his freedom and claimed he was part of a detachment that had concealed
        the booty looted in Aedirn. We couldn't believe our fortune, thought
        the gods had smiled upon us. We'd heard incredible tales of this
        treasure, questioned any Black One we'd captured. It seemed all our
        efforts would finally be rewarded. We decided to make him talk.
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> By torturing him?
<p><span class="tag">GRIDLEY:</span> Our commander wanted to break him on the wheel, but Rupert said he
        knew a better way. There's a local herb - if you brew and drink it,
        you can only tell the truth.
<p><span class="tag">GRIDLEY:</span> The commander interrogated the prisoner, drawing a map in the process.
        And we celebrated, talked of how we would divide the treasure, and took
        ever greater liberties with the patients. The priest looking after them
        began to protest, and one of our boys... split his head open.
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Nice, Gridley. Keep talking and I just might let you go alive and
        intact. What happened next?
<p><span class="tag">GRIDLEY:</span> Once the prisoner revealed where the treasure was hidden, the
        commander had him quartered in front of the lunatics... They'd shown
        signs of madness before, but when they smelled blood, well, we could
        not control them. Many we simply had to cut down... I don't even know
        how the fire broke out.
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Any of the patients survive?
<p><span class="tag">GRIDLEY:</span> A young woman we managed to pull from the burning building. She was
        nice, quiet and... willing. Two nights later she slit our commander's
        throat and that was all we saw of her, and of the map, of course. The
        war was ongoing and shifting fronts forced us to abandon our search for
        her soon after.
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> And here you are, back after many years. Really think you can still
        find her around here?
<p><span class="tag">GRIDLEY:</span> Life's not treated me well since then, and Rupert's had it even worse.
        This is our chance to reverse our fortunes. Fate smiled upon us once,
        perhaps by some strange chance it still holds us in favor?
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> *Sigh* I wouldn't count on that. I think we're dealing with one heavy
        curse here, and it looks like we need to start by finding that
        Nilfgaardian's corpse.</div>
