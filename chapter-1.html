           support of the Scoia'tael... I want no gold and have no interest in a

           Helpless, yet masking that with acts of increasing cruelty.

       to resolve the problem of our so-called kayran - the beast that now
       blocks all trade traffic on the river.

        you make of it all?
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> The beast must be huge. Maybe inhabited one of the Pontar's tributaries
        before, hunting animals... Then it grew for some reason and hunger
        drove it to seek fresh pastures.
