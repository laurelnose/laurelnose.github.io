Sitting comfortably? Then listen...<p><span class="tag">CHORAB:</span> Not so long ago, our King Foltest had a daughter named Adda. The girl died, but an evil man cursed her and wouldn't let her rest in peace.<p><span class="tag">CHORAB:</span> Adda was reborn as a striga. She left her sarcophagus at night and, hungry for human flesh, hunted on Vizima's streets.<p><span class="tag">CHORAB:</span> The city was frozen with fear, and the King promised a reward for lifting the curse from his daughter. Many tried, but they all failed.<p><span class="tag">CHORAB:</span> Then a witcher came to Vizima. He heard people out, examined wounds left by the striga's talons, and accepted the job, despite many warnings.<p><span class="tag">CHORAB:</span> The witcher fought the beast the whole night. He led her on, dodged her fangs, and parried her furious attacks. Though he was close to death, he didn't want to kill her.<p><span class="tag">CHORAB:</span> This was the first time the striga saw such fierceness in a man. She felt the strength of his iron will and backed down.<p><span class="tag">CHORAB:</span> Witchers know how to dispel enchantments and spells like nobody else. That brave soul also knew how to lift the curse.<p><span class="tag">CHORAB:</span> He sealed himself in the striga's sarcophagus, beside her mother's corpse, and waited for morning. The third cock-crow lifted the evil spell and turned the striga back into a princess.<p><span class="tag">CHORAB:</span> However, the curse was not dispelled immediately. The witcher nearly died, attacked by the beast in girl's form.<p><span class="tag">CHORAB:</span> The King's men found him, bleeding. They also found the princess, cured, but still feeble of mind.<p><span class="tag">CHORAB:</span> That's how Foltest regained his daughter. Such things do happen under the sun and the moon.</div><div class="dialogue"><p><span class="tag">CHORAB:</span> Today I'll tell ye how Lobinden came to be.<p><span class="tag">CHORAB:</span> A long time ago, our forefathers came to this shore. The King granted them land, on the condition they clear the forest.<p><span class="tag">CHORAB:</span> Back then, like now, the wilderness was a dark, dreadful place. But our forefathers wanted to settle here badly.<p><span class="tag">CHORAB:</span> They spent their nights on their riverboat. From the deck they could hear the Old Man and the howling of werewolves. During the day, they tried to clear the forest with fire and axe.<p><span class="tag">CHORAB:</span> The trees, however, were too large and too tough for Aedirnian steel. And the forest responded to fire by sending ever deadlier nightmares from its depths.<p><span class="tag">CHORAB:</span> A priestess came here with the settlers. A wise woman, who finally said that this land belonged to no man, and would never submit to man.<p><span class="tag">CHORAB:</span> The priestess led the men deep into the forest and showed them the altar of the old god Veyopatis. All understood this land would never belong to them and they could only settle its edge at best.<p><span class="tag">CHORAB:</span> Our forefathers bowed before Veyopatis and offered him sacrifice, and he protected them from the forest and gave them the river rich in fish.<p><span class="tag">CHORAB:</span> They posted poles in the forest, to forever mark the boundary between the human and that which be not.<p><span class="tag">CHORAB:</span> That is how it was, is, and will yet be.</div><div class="subsectionhead"><div><h3 id="portside"> <a href="#portside" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="portside"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Portside</h3></div><nav class="sectionnav"> <a href="#aroundfire">&lt; PREV</a> <a href="#contents">CONTENTS</a> <a href="#portside">NEXT &gt;</a></nav></div><br><div class="dialogue"><p><span class="tag">FISHWIFE:</span> Ugh, dinner's ready, soup's getting cold.<p><span class="tag">FISHERMAN:</span> Hush...<p><span class="tag">FISHWIFE:</span> Come on!<p><span class="tag">FISHERMAN:</span> Can't ye see I'm fishing, woman?<p><span class="tag">FISHWIFE:</span> Always fishing and fishing!
