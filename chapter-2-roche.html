<p class="stage">[TITLE TEXT: Upper Aedirn in the Pontar Valley - Two days after leaving Flotsam]</p>

<p class="stage">[The camera zooms out to reveal King Henselt with Sile and Dethmold standing behind him.]</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<p><span class="tag">DETHMOLD:</span> It must've been a massacre! Bones everywhere! How in the world did
        Glevissig harness so much of the Power?
<p><span class="tag">SÍLE:</span> Do you always get so excited at the sight of skulls, Dethmold?
<p><span class="tag">DETHMOLD:</span> Scoff all you want. I speak of magic! The kind of spells that win
        wars! Thousands incinerated in seconds! Mmmmwaah! Power, destruction,
        annihilation!
<p><span class="tag">SÍLE:</span> Yes, after which Sabrina Glevissig was burned at the stake, and the
        Pontar Valley remains within Aedirn's borders.
<p><span class="tag">DETHMOLD:</span> Aedirn is a carcass! Still showing life signs, but the realm's days
        are numbered. No peasant revolt can change that!
<p><span class="tag">HENSELT:</span> You're wrong, Dethmold. This country lives, I can feel it. Like an
        old, wounded bear, covered in scars, hounds all around it, but still
        strong, still deadly. This will be a good war.
<p><span class="tag">DETHMOLD:</span> But, Sire! The Aedirnian barons won't dare stand against you. You
        shall see that shortly, I've prepared everything!</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<p><span class="tag">DETHMOLD:</span> De Tansarville, can you feel that? Magic still beats strongly in this
        place. Shivers run down my spine.
<p><span class="tag">SÍLE:</span> Hm. Strange... Glevissig's Quadruple Sun is a short duration spell. It
        should have dissipated long ago.
<p><span class="tag">DETHMOLD:</span> An anomaly, perhaps? Not uncommon... The sheer amount of Power she
        summoned – I doubt she retained complete control...
<p><span class="tag">HENSELT:</span> Stop discussing Sabrina Glevissig or I promise you that heads will roll.</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<p><span class="tag">DETHMOLD:</span> Baron Felart has forever hinted that he would gladly change his
        colors...
<p><span class="tag">SÍLE:</span> Felart is unparalleled scum.
<p><span class="tag">DETHMOLD:</span> The other nobles are panic-stricken at the very thought of Saskia
        with her peasant and nonhuman rebels. They are unprepared to fight and
        know it very well.
<p><span class="tag">HENSELT:</span> And Demavend's cub? Has he named his price?
<p><span class="tag">DETHMOLD:</span> Prince Stennis has yet to respond, but Felart has assured me...
<p><span class="tag">HENSELT:</span> I must see him, look into his eyes. I'll know what he's made of, then.</div>

<p class="stage">[Henselt, Síle, and Dethmold make their way down the hill to the tent where
   the Aedirnian nobles are waiting.]</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<p><span class="tag">FELART:</span> We most humbly greet His Majesty Henselt, King of Kaedwen, heir to the
        Dynasty of the Unicorn, Lord of Ard Carraigh, Archduke of Ban Ard and
        vanquisher of Nilfgaard!
<p><span class="tag">NOBLEMAN:</span> Welcome to Aedirn.
<p><span class="tag">HENSELT:</span> How much do you want?
<p><span class="tag">FELART:</span> You Majesty surely jests...
<p><span class="tag">HENSELT:</span> I couldn't be more serious. How much for your signatures?
<p><span class="tag">FELART:</span> A hundred thousand Novigrad crowns, we thought. To each of us. And the
        titles of marquis.
<p><span class="tag">DETHMOLD:</span> Ooooh!
<p><span class="tag">FELART:</span> We speak of Upper Aedirn, of coal and silver mines, numerous factories,
        the sole white marble quarry this side of the Yaruga, and the North's
        main east-west trade route...
<p><span class="tag">DETHMOLD:</span> We speak of Lormark. I advise you to adopt the new nomenclature.
<p><span class="tag">FELART:</span> In exchange, we shall swear fealty and acknowledge Your Majesty as
        sovereign of these lands.</div>

<div class="indent">
   <div class="choice"><span>I'll give you half.
   </span></div>
   <div class="dialogue">
   <p><span class="tag">HENSELT:</span> You'll receive fifty thousand apiece and no additional titles.
   <p><span class="tag">HENSELT:</span> Also, you'll provide guides and supplies to my army. My men will
           install themselves in your castles. Your armed men will gather under
           sorcerer Dethmold's command and will set out to quell the peasant
           rebellion.
   <p><span class="tag">FELART:</span> Sire, the common folk will hate... They simply won't understand...
   <p><span class="tag">HENSELT:</span> Yes, Felart, they will hate you. But at least this way you'll live.
           Comfortably, I might add. Refuse and die – by my hand or that of
           Saskia the Dragonslayer.
   <p><span class="tag">FELART:</span> Sire... We accept your conditions.
   <p><span class="tag">HENSELT:</span> Dethmold – the scroll!
   <p><span class="tag">FELART:</span> Sire, there is yet the matter of Prince Stennis and his rights to
           these lands. So long as he lives... Ahem... So long as the Prince
           lives, he'll force his claims...
   <p><span class="tag">HENSELT:</span> Then kill him, Felart.
   <p><span class="tag">FELART:</span> Sire, I'm no warrior.
   <p><span class="tag">HENSELT:</span> In that case, shut up and sign.
   <p><span class="tag">KAEDWENI KNIGHT:</span> Sire, the Dragonslayer approaches, white flag in hand!
   <p><span class="tag">HENSELT:</span> Excellent, let her pass.
   <p><span class="tag">DETHMOLD:</span> What are you waiting for? Pick up those quills and sign.</div>

   <div class="choice"><span>I'll give you nothing.
   </span></div>
   <div class="dialogue">
   <p><span class="tag">HENSELT:</span> I shall give you naught for your worthless signatures. I have no
           need of them.
   <p><span class="tag">NOBLEMAN:</span> But Your Majesty, without our support you'll forever be the
           invader, the occupying force, the enemy. The folk of Aedirn...
   <p><span class="tag">HENSELT:</span> The folk of Aedirn follows Saskia the Dragonslayer and Prince
           Stennis. I wish to speak to them.
   <p><span class="tag">KAEDWENI KNIGHT:</span> Sire, the Dragonslayer approaches, white flag in hand!

<p><span class="tag">SASKIA:</span> King, command your vulture to shut his beak, before I thrust his
        cockerel up his arse and twist so hard he'll crow until noon reverts
        to morning.
<p><span class="tag">DETHMOLD:</span> I... Sire, you must have her restrained!

           your piece, woman.</div>

   <div class="dialogue">
   <p><span class="tag">SASKIA:</span> King, withdraw your army, recognize Upper Aedirn's sovereignty, end
           your persecution of nonhumans and give them leave to quit your
           realm... Do this and save yourself and your army.
   <p><span class="tag">HENSELT:</span> Ha–ha–ha! You have balls, woman, but what would I gain? My soldiers
           would call me a coward. I am Henselt of Ard Carraigh – I'll not run
           from a woman, even if she be a dragonslayer.
   <p><span class="tag">SASKIA:</span> I see one other solution.
   <p><span class="tag">SASKIA:</span> You and I, King. Here and now. Before these folk and the gods. I
           challenge you. As in the old days, when the honorable ruled this
           world. Upper Aedirn to the victor.
   <p><span class="tag">FELART:</span> The lass has gone mad. To challenge a king?!
   <p><span class="tag">DETHMOLD:</span> Sire, this is absurd! We shall crush them in battle. They say the
           lass has slain a dragon - she could be dangerous.</div>

              respect. Were I to restrain you, there would be no war. You are
              either very brave or very stupid...

                 Knights and footmen who fought like lions! Who proved that
                 blood, not water, coursed through their veins!
         <p><span class="tag">HENSELT:</span> The people of Lormark deserve a strong and just ruler. They

         <p><span class="tag">SASKIA:</span> You speak not to subjects but to free folk, King. You come
                 with an army that loots the surrounding villages. You
                 negotiate with traitors of this land. You allow your mages to
                 threaten and offend. And I am to kneel before you?

<p><span class="tag">DETHMOLD:</span> Witcher, a word, if you will.
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<p><span class="tag">DETHMOLD:</span> You have no idea how delighted I am to work in tandem with you.
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> True, I have no idea.
<p><span class="tag">DETHMOLD:</span> Better times approach, Geralt, you shall see. I trust you're not
        bothered if I refer to you by name?
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Not at all.
<p><span class="tag">DETHMOLD:</span> Wonderful! I feel we shall become great friends...
</div>

<div class="indent">
   <div class="choice"><span>Time will tell.
   </span></div>
   <div class="dialogue">
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> That remains to be seen.
   <p><span class="tag">DETHMOLD:</span> Shake my hand, Geralt. To mark the beginning of our friendship!
           Don't worry, I've no poison needle up my sleeve...</div>

      <div class="indent">
      <div class="choice"><span>Have it your way.

      <div class="dialogue">
      <p><span class="tag">DETHMOLD:</span> I believe one can learn much about a man from his handshake.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Learned anything?
      <p><span class="tag">DETHMOLD:</span> You have the handshake of a warrior - strong, decisive,
              dominating. You're the conquering type. The kind women love...
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I was asking about the curse.
      <p><span class="tag">DETHMOLD:</span> Ah! Of course! What would you like to know?
      </div></div>

   <div class="choice"><span>Let's get to work.
   </span></div>
   <div class="dialogue">
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I'm not looking for new friends, Dethmold. Let's get to work.
   <p><span class="tag">DETHMOLD:</span> I see... As you seem to be the hero, how might I help you, White
           Wolf?</div>

      <div class="indent">
      <div class="choice"><span>Why is Henselt still alive?
      </span></div>
      <div class="dialogue">
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Why is Henselt still breathing? He killed the priest - why
              didn't he burst like a ripe tomato under a dwarf's heel?
      <p><span class="tag">DETHMOLD:</span> Perhaps Glevissig wishes Henselt to wait for imminent death?
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I don't think so. I know a few sorceresses. They're mean,
              true, but they also want results. Sabrina cast the curse while
              roasting at the stake. Not the most comfortable circumstances.
              I suspect she botched something.
      <p><span class="tag">DETHMOLD:</span> Are you suggesting Henselt may be safe?
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I'm suggesting he could be saved. Provided we cut him off from
              the heart of the curse - the battle of specters. It's the
              weakest link.
      <p><span class="tag">DETHMOLD:</span> How could we do that?
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I don't know yet. But I suspect I could summon Sabrina's ghost
              and force her to free Henselt. First, I need to learn the
              circumstances of her death.</div>

      <div class="choice"><span>A blood curse usually requires blood...
      </span></div>
      <div class="dialogue">
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> If I'm not mistaken, you need blood to cast a blood curse.
      <p><span class="tag">DETHMOLD:</span> Precisely – unachievable otherwise.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Sabrina was bound to a wagon wheel. Where did she get enough
              blood?
      <p><span class="tag">DETHMOLD:</span> She put a spell on a soldier, who gave her a coup de grace.
              It was easy, the minds of some soldiers are so uncomplicated...
              Sabrina needed one of them to strike her, shorten her
              suffering but complete the curse. However, this is where she
              erred! That whore performed miracles, gathered the Power, got
              the prophecy and activator right, but fell flat on her face
              on the simplest thing at the end!
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Don't get so excited.
      <p><span class="tag">DETHMOLD:</span> She chose a fool, a bungler. I heard he thrust five times
              with his spear, yet the witch's soul would not quit her corpse.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> There was no one guarding the pyre?
      <p><span class="tag">DETHMOLD:</span> It was one of the guards the sorceress chose for the task.
              His comrades were irate – he spoiled the show for them. The
              King was no longer anywhere near.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> In any case, blood flowed and the curse took root.
      <p><span class="tag">DETHMOLD:</span> Yes, but the harlot got her due.</div>

      <div class="choice"><span>Not all the specters were aggressive. Did you notice that?
      </span></div>
      <div class="dialogue">
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Did you notice that not all the specters were aggressive?
      <p><span class="tag">DETHMOLD:</span> Mm... Most would disappear when we neared them.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I think the curse's power corrupts the ghosts of those who
              died in the battle, turning them into draugirs.
      <p><span class="tag">DETHMOLD:</span> Draugirs? Is that some professional name you witchers have
              for specters?
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> They're demons, Dethmold. Draugirs are demons of war that
              arise on battlefields where the fighting was vicious and the
              slaughter particularly bloody. They are hatred and blood lust
              in condensed form.
      <p><span class="tag">DETHMOLD:</span> The name matters little. Do you know how to rid us of these
              draugirs?
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> A silver sword's enough to send them to their rest. But as
              long as the curse remains active, new ones will appear. The
              soldiers' ghosts are the key. If we could reverse the tide of
              the battle...
      <p><span class="tag">DETHMOLD:</span> Don't delay! Grab your sword and start reversing...
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I'll need some symbols of war that belonged to the soldiers
              who perished here. Artifacts symbolizing hatred, death,
              courage and faith. They have to be magically active and
              linked to those who died. Without them, I won't be able to
              summon the ghosts.
      <p><span class="tag">DETHMOLD:</span> Well I've no idea how to find them. Apart from which, I know
              little about war symbolism...
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I'll deal with the artifacts. I have another job for you.</div>

      <div class="choice"><span>Lifted any curses before?
      </span></div>
      <div class="dialogue">
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Have you dealt with curses before?
      <p><span class="tag">DETHMOLD:</span> I've cast a few in my time. One victim sprouted donkey's
              ears and a tail, another's house burned down... Nothing too
              serious.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Shame... Have you removed curses, lifted spells?
      <p><span class="tag">DETHMOLD:</span> Never had the chance. But I mastered the theory involved –
              best in my class at the magic academy.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> They don't teach you about curses like this one at Ban Ard.
      <p><span class="tag">DETHMOLD:</span> Glevissig's curse is a fourth-level blood spell. It's also
              known as the "Arch Mistress's curse." A misnomer, for they
              have been cast by generally crazed mages or priests, not
              necessarily women.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> You've done your homework.</div>

      <div class="choice"><span>How does a blood curse work?
      </span></div>
      <div class="dialogue">
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Explain this blood curse to me.
      <p><span class="tag">DETHMOLD:</span> An ordinary blood curse is a trivial thing. You let a little
              of your own blood – best done at midnight, surrounded by lit
              candles.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Sabrina had a whole pyre around her. Tell me about
              Glevissig's curse.
      <p><span class="tag">DETHMOLD:</span> Read about it for yourself, I've all the necessary literature.
              In fact, you only need the "Great Encyclopedia of Curses, Spells
              and Prophecies" and a volume compiled by Tissaia de Vries and
              Margarita Laux-Antille - "Masters of Magic on Curses - Selected
              Writings."</div>

         <div class="indent">
         <div class="choice"><span>All right. I'll read them.
         </span></div>
         <div class="dialogue"><p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Quite a tome...</div>

         <div class="choice"><span>I don't have time to read.
         </span></div>
         <div class="dialogue">
         <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I'm not going to waste my time reading. Tell me the
                 important bits.
         <p><span class="tag">DETHMOLD:</span> Oh... Oh, no need to be ashamed, Geralt. In these times
                 few get the opportunity to learn the arts of reading and
                 writing. Illiteracy is...
         <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I can read, mage. Time's a-wasting – are you gonna start
                 helping me?</div></div>

         <div class="dialogue">
         <p><span class="tag">DETHMOLD:</span> The effects and phenomena generated by a fourth level
                 blood curse require an immense amount of the Power. The
                 eclipse, the death of a dynasty, the battle of specters...
                 No sorcerer, no living being, can summon such levels of
                 energy. It's quite simply impossible.
         <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> But some clever mages discovered how to make possible the
                 impossible. Since then the world has lived in fear of your
                 curses. Genius. What did you discover?
         <p><span class="tag">DETHMOLD:</span> A prophecy that initiates a blood curse is simply a spell
                 that binds the Power. It should be cast at a site
                 possessing the appropriate accumulation characteristics.
         <p><span class="tag">DETHMOLD:</span> A battlefield is perfect: blood-soaked ground, defined
                 boundaries, a symbolic dimension. When the caster utters
                 the words of the prophecy, the curse begins to accumulate
                 the Power. For the last three years – day after day, month
                 after month – the initiating curse has been gathering the
                 Power, drawing it from the elements of fire, earth, air
                 and water.
         <p><span class="tag">DETHMOLD:</span> The energy thus accumulated could move the stars...
         <p><span class="tag">DETHMOLD:</span> Enter the activator – one of the prophesied events,
                 possessing its own symbolic dimension. It releases the
                 accumulated energy for use by the curse proper. Ordinarily,
                 the curse cannot utilize all the built up Power, which must
                 be released in some way. So one gets side effects, like
                 solar eclipses...</div>


      <div class="choice"><span>Are you sure Sabrina cast the curse?
      </span></div>
      <div class="dialogue">
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Are you sure Sabrina cast the curse?
      <p><span class="tag">DETHMOLD:</span> Positively. Curses of this kind are cast rarely. There have
              only been six confirmed cases.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> How many confirmed cases of their being lifted?
      <p><span class="tag">DETHMOLD:</span> One. By a team of mages led by Arch Mistress Francesca
              Findabair, whence came the curse's other appelation. In any
              case, Sabrina Glevissig was part of that team...
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Small world. And one that just got a little uglier.
      <p><span class="tag">DETHMOLD:</span> That's not all. The curse that Francesca and Sabrina dealt
              with was meant to end the lives of the last of the Thyssen
              dynasty, the rulers of Kovir. It was cast by Scarlet
              Rodallega... A very talented, but completely mad man. A
              prophecy and an activator were also involved.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I see. Sabrina just stole her curse from this Rodallega.
      <p><span class="tag">DETHMOLD:</span> Precisely. Besides which, the King himself and a company of
              armed men witnessed her casting it.</div>

      <div class="choice"><span>What's with the coins?
      </span></div>
      <div class="dialogue">
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> We've got our comet and murder. What about the coins?
      <p><span class="tag">DETHMOLD:</span> We have those as well. Not enough for you?
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> No. Why do I get the feeling I've stumbled on some shameful
              secret?
      <p><span class="tag">DETHMOLD:</span> A state secret.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> If you don't tell me, your head of state may soon lose his
              head...
      <p><span class="tag">DETHMOLD:</span> There's a plot afoot within the military. Those involved
              share a symbol – a square coin adorned with a fish. Let's do
              this: I shall in no way hinder your investigation and you will
              reveal to me anything you learn. Should I happen upon anything
              related to the curse...
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> You'll let me know. So be it.</div>

      <div class="choice"><span>Let's get to work.
      </span></div>
      <div class="dialogue">
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> You're gonna help me, Dethmold.
      <p><span class="tag">DETHMOLD:</span> Of course, as the King ordered.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Listen up. You'll do the paperwork - I get the feeling you
              like it. I'll need a number of protective runes to summon
              Sabrina's ghost.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> They need to detain the sorceress' ghost and anything else
              that enters this world with it. Find something for me in your
              library. The runes need to be easy to produce – I haven't seen
              any artists around here.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Apart from that, the draugirs are likely to begin their forays
              in search of Henselt. When they leave the battlefield,
              they'll grow weaker. Your men should be able to handle them.
              Just equip them with silver-plated weapons.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Henselt could also use something silver to defend himself.
              Over the entrance to his tent, hang a wreath of cinquefoil and
              fool's parsley. Inside, a fire fueled by juniper branches must
              burn at all times.
      <p><span class="tag">DETHMOLD:</span> Where will I get so much silver?
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Melt down your collection of pots, for all I care. Just get it.
      <p><span class="tag">DETHMOLD:</span> Those aren't pots! They're silver vases of Nazair!
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Last of all: give Henselt an instructional talk, explain that
              I'll need him.
      <p><span class="tag">DETHMOLD:</span> And what will you be doing? Drinking ale and fondling the
              camp women?
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> There's that, yes, though I'll also prepare to summon
              Sabrina's ghost and figure out what I need to send the
              fighting specters back to the afterlife. I'll drop by and
              give you more work as I learn about this curse.
      <p><span class="tag">DETHMOLD:</span> How did you divine that you might recover your memory by
              lifting the curse?</div>

         <div class="indent">

         <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> My past has nothing to do with Henselt.

   <p><span class="tag">ZYVIK:</span> I did, and I fought... But I'd rather not go into it.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> The spirits of those who died in battle are now in combat on that

           draugirs. Aedirnians, Kaedwenis, even your comrades... I want to
           help them, but I have to know what happened during the battle.
   <p><span class="tag">ZYVIK:</span> Oh the plague, listen then!
   <p><span class="tag">ZYVIK:</span> The fighting started in the afternoon. The Dun Banner was first to
           attack. We were ambushed, cut off from our main unit and
           devastated... Bloody scouts and Sabrina Glevissig, who was supposed
           to mind the battlefield...
   <p><span class="tag">ZYVIK:</span> By then, the battle was in full swing. Wherever you see those damned
           furrows... people fought there. The Aedirnian lines faltered a few
           times, but we couldn't crush them because of Seltkirk...
   <p><span class="tag">ZYVIK:</span> Yes, we had the Visitor, they had Seltkirk of Gulet, the invincible
           white knight, Aedirn's finest swordsman. Wherever our forces gained
           the upper hand, he'd appear and reverse the fighting's course.
   <p><span class="tag">ZYVIK:</span> Then Vandergrift himself went into battle. He met Seltkirk in the
           middle of the melee. It was a battle of titans. In the end, the
           Visitor hacked Seltkirk and sliced the white knight from his head to
           his balls.
   <p><span class="tag">ZYVIK:</span> Then death fell from the heavens. Lumps of burning soil flew through
           the air, the whole valley was on fire... Damned magic of a damned
           witch!
   <p><span class="tag">ZYVIK:</span> I owe my life to Priest Chrest, our chaplain. He led me out of the
           battle and went back for the others. He had a medallion that
           protected him against fire. He led everyone out, including the
           Aedirnians, but the flames got him in the end.</div>

   <div class="dialogue">
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> What happened before the battle?
   <p><span class="tag">ZYVIK:</span> We forded the Pontar on the third day after the autumn equinox. The
           Aedirnians were waiting for us, formed up in a long line at the
           foot of those hills. I remember the banners of Vengerberg,
           Aldersberg, Gulet... Knights, armored infantry, peasants, the
           Vergen dwarf regiment... All save the King. They numbered more than
           five thousand.
   <p><span class="tag">ZYVIK:</span> General Vandergrift, commander of the Kaedwenis, had less than four
           thousand, including the elite Bearheads, armored troops from Ard
           Carraigh, and the famous White Foxes of the North. And ourselves,
           the Dun Banner, veterans of Brenna, hated by the Aedirnians more
           than the plague.
   <p><span class="tag">ZYVIK:</span> But above all, we had Vandergrift the Visitor. Maybe he was a
           bastard, but he knew war like nobody else.</div>

      <p><span class="tag">ZYVIK:</span> From a distance. At the time I was on that hill and they were
              somewhere over there. The field used to be as flat as a table...
      <p><span class="tag">ZYVIK:</span> It was their second duel. Earlier, in peace time, they'd met at a
              tournament in Ard Carraigh. Seltkirk won then. Vandergrift's
              sword cracked and the Visitor had to yield. After the tournament,
              he had a new sword forged by Kaedwen's best mages and
              swordsmiths. That's how "Loa'then" came to be.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I think that means "hatred" in the elder language - pretty
              pretentious.
      <p><span class="tag">ZYVIK:</span> They say a sorcerer cast a spell on the sword and told Vandergrift
              the blade wouldn't crack as long as he remained invincible...
              The mage got fifty lashes and was the last to mention any such
              nonsense.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Who has Vandergrift's sword, now?
      <p><span class="tag">ZYVIK:</span> When the sea of flames died out, the looters ran amok. They found
              Seltkirk's chainmail, which survived somehow. Maybe it was
              magical, too... Vandergrift's sword went missing. The boys in the
              camp claim the female dragonslayer has it. But I wouldn't even
              try talking to her...
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Who's got Seltkirk's chainmail?
      <p><span class="tag">ZYVIK:</span> Er... A certain Vinson Traut. Low nobility, in the army since

      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Where can I find him?
      <p><span class="tag">ZYVIK:</span> That's a problem. Dethmold wanted him arrested after they found a
              square coin on him. Some of the officers and noblemen want to get
              rid of the Black Ones. They don't like how they lord it around
              the camp, even that the King talks to them. Those coins are their
              sign, the stupid bunch of plotters...
      <p><span class="tag">ZYVIK:</span> Anyway, Vinson's a swashbuckler, he thrashed Dethmold's people
              and disappeared. Those with the coins won't say a word because
              they're scared of Dethmold.</div>

           prevail. It's been in worse shite than this. The Dun will be all

           time. Menno Coehoorn commanded the Nilfgaardians... He was some

      <p><span class="tag">VISIONARY:</span> Of course. A well-deserved punishment - a ghostly spell from
              her crimson lips!
      <p><span class="tag">VISIONARY:</span> The King concocted a cruel fate for the sorceress, humiliated
              her, made her suffer the flames. Bound to a wheel and placed on
              the stake, she suffered in a way unimaginable to ordinary humans.
      <p><span class="tag">VISIONARY:</span> But when the flame reached her maiden waist, not a single cry
              could be heard, only words foretelling King Henselt's imminent
              demise. Let a shooting star split the heavens and mark its mortal
              journey with a braid of blood! Let fools be duped by the sight
              of fish scales turned by magic into square pieces of gold! Let
              the Unicorn violate thousand year-old rules, prompting a just
              punishment!
      <p><span class="tag">VISIONARY:</span> Sabrina suffered so badly that a merciful soldier ended her
              torment, thrusting his spear into her aching heart.</div>

              mages burned at the stake?
      <p><span class="tag">VISIONARY:</span> Others were strong in life. Her power bloomed when death
              wrapped its steely arms around her. She took the soldier who
              ended her suffering under her kind care. He never had to fear
              walking alone in the dark again.
      <p><span class="tag">VISIONARY:</span> Have you seen the area? It's full of beasts and monstrosities.
              Yahon, the merciful soldier, has walked in the blaze of her power
              ever since. No creature born of darkness can get close to him.</div>

           and the cries of the dying. If you want to soothe their pain, you
           have to believe that Sabrina is watching over you benevolently.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I won't achieve anything without some memory tokens - magically
           active conduits left by those who fell in battle. They're supposed
           to symbolize faith, courage, hatred and death.
   <p><span class="tag">VISIONARY:</span> Faith? I don't know what those soldiers believed, but their faith
           didn't help them, they were deceived. Courage, hatred and death?
           There was too much of all of them... Especially death. But I
           remember a knight who, ignoring the danger, led a handful of
           soldiers against overwhelming enemy forces.
   <p><span class="tag">VISIONARY:</span> Seltkirk of Gulet, Demavend's champion. When Vandergrift's
           cohort cut him off from the rest of the army, he attacked the

      <p><span class="tag">SKALEN:</span> Try the nether world. The whole unit was cut down during the
              battle three years ago...
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I meant the unit's standard - which symbolizes death.
      <p><span class="tag">SKALEN:</span> Ah, that makes it a lot easier. We buried it with the remains of
              the Kaedwenis.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Where?
      <p><span class="tag">SKALEN:</span> Just outside Vergen... I'll mark it on your map as the road could
              get confusing. Strange things are afoot in those crypts, witcher.
              Kaedweni ghosts scaring off our folk - that would be normal,
              since they were invaders. But one's some kind of amateur
              historian, askin' all that venture there about the battle and the
              Dun Banner.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I'll look into it. Thanks.</div>

      <div class="choice"><span>Triss and the kingslayer might be in this area.
      </span></div>
      <div class="dialogue">
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Triss could be somewhere in this area...
      <p><span class="tag">YARPEN:</span> The plague, I've not seen her five years, must be... Since that
              day they proclaimed you dead. Last saw her in Rivia, in any case.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> From what I've been able to establish, the kingslayer forced her
              to teleport the two of them to this area. And she's not on the
              other side of the fog.
      <p><span class="tag">YARPEN:</span> What did this kingslayer look like?
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> A huge, bald witcher. Wears a medallion with a snake on it.
      <p><span class="tag">YARPEN:</span> Sorry, Geralt, doesn't even ring the tiniest bell, any of that...
      <p><span class="tag">SKALEN:</span> I might know something... This drunk in Vergen claims he saw a
              redhead fall from the sky somewhere among the ravines. And then
              he said the sorceress Philippa Eilhart came around looking for
              this woman.
      <p><span class="tag">YARPEN:</span> Shriveled old minx...
      <p><span class="tag">SKALEN:</span> She sent her servant and some peasants to the ravines after her,
              but they came back empty-handed. Now Philippa's serving maid's
              gone, leaving the sorceress angry as a wasp - she even turned
              one of the plebs into a pig.
      <p><span class="tag">SKALEN:</span> I spoke to one of those peasants. He claims the lass was no
              servant, but a Nilfgaardian agent, and she apparently found
              something in those ravines - maybe it was Triss, and maybe it
              was that witcher. Madame Eilhart, or the old minx, as Yarpen
              calls her, knows she's been duped and can't forgive herself for
              it.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Did the woman flee south? Deeper into Aedirn?
      <p><span class="tag">YARPEN:</span> Fuckin' hell, she came out the main gate not more than an hour
              ago. Headed straight for the fog. Thought she might be out to do
              some magic probing or whatnot...
      <p><span class="tag">SKALEN:</span> She knew a bit of magic. She might've crossed.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I guess I need to visit Shilard when I get back.</div>

      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> How's Iorveth? Any chance I might run into him?
      <p><span class="tag">SKALEN:</span> Minimal. He follows Saskia around like a once neglected pup,
              eyes on her at all times.
      <p><span class="tag">YARPEN:</span> At least the lass is well-protected. What do you seek from
              Iorveth? Last I heard, you weren't exactly chummy...
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> You heard right, but when I last saw him in Flotsam, he had
              something I need to lift the curse.
      <p><span class="tag">ZOLTAN:</span> Even if you see him, I doubt he'll give you anything out of the
              kindness of his heart. Perhaps Saskia can convince him.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Guess I don't have much of a choice.</div>

              certain sword.
      <p><span class="tag">YARPEN:</span> Wait a minute. If by some miracle you obtain that cursed blade,
              I'd advise you not to parade it out the main gate past the
              Squirrels...
      <p><span class="tag">ZOLTAN:</span> Got another solution?
      <p><span class="tag">YARPEN:</span> There's another passage. I'll mark it on the witcher's map and

      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> It does. In the meantime, I'll look around for that flag...

   the mists, he finds the body of a Nilfgaardian soldier with a letter from
   Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen on him; the order is for the capture of Triss
   Merigold. When he emerges from the mist he finds several Blue Stripes
   looking over the bodies of several Nilfgaardians.]

<div class="dialogue">
<p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> Good, you're here. The Nilfgaardians attacked us.
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Any idea why?
<p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> They were loitering around here, staring into the fog as if waiting for
        something. I summoned Fenn, Silas and a few others, and told Ves to
        cover us from a distance while we went to talk to them. So I asked the
        black dogs, courteously, why they were gazing into the fog as if the
        emperor himself was about to emerge from it. No answer. But I can see
        the anger, knitted brows, faces reddening... And they start growling to
        each other in that dog's tongue of theirs.
<p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> A woman came out of the mist. Beautiful and barely alive, she dropped to
        the ground, and a small object slipped from her hand... It was a jade
        figurine, no larger than a man's hand. If I didn't know it was
        impossible, I'd say it was Triss turned into a statuette.
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> It is possible - artifact compression. Where's this woman?
<p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> I dunno. The girl growled at the soldiers and all hell broke loose. The

        save her.
<p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> It's not an option. They'll not let us sail until you lift the curse,
        and we've no chance of catching the Nilfgaardians on foot. If they
        wanted to kill her, she'd be dead already.
<p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> Besides which we know where they've gone. Loc Muinne, witcher. The
        monarchs and mages are to meet and decide the fate of the known world.

   November 23, 1269 – Cintra, the village of Coldwater, and another victim of

   chance. I'm tired.

   February 24, 1270 – A high pass in the Armush Mountains. An imperial
   manticore – one of the world’s oldest and deadliest monsters. I used to feel
   excitement at moments like this, now the beast is only an obstacle on my
   way. Its meat and hot blood will help me survive this icy hell.

   May 30, 1270 – The Yaruga River. The Hunt continues to race south. Since

           promised them a thing or two, and moved against Vergen. The battle's

           was low following the failed campaign. We took advantage. I bought

<div class="stage">[DANDELION, NARRATING: Síle de Tansarville! I'd sensed from the start that
   some dark mystery lay behind that cold countenance...
   <div class="narbreak">&nbsp;</div>
   Following the demise of the Council and Conclave, there was no one left to
   keep the mages in line, but regicide? Why? What was this all about? It
   seemed these questions would be answered at Loc Muinne... an ancient city
   amidst mountains, the remnants of the civilization of the Vrans, whose dusk
   had come long ago.
   <div class="narbreak">&nbsp;</div>
   And you would be right to ask, "Why did you not set out for Loc Muinne,
   Master Dandelion?" Your humble servant and chronicler was forced to flee the
   Pontar Valley as he very well might have paid with his life for his heroic
   stand against King Henselt. And to allow oneself to be humbly slaughtered,
   consigning to oblivion this account of incredible events, would be a grave
   transgression against the arts and letters.
   <div class="narbreak">&nbsp;</div>
   Yet forever feeling a vast, shared responsbiilty for the fate of the North,
   I dispatched to Loc Muinne my faithful and capable friend, Geralt of Rivia.
   Have I mentioned his disdain for politics? Well, it was at Loc Muinne where
   he could finally give vent to it.]</div>
