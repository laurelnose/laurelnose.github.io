<div class="dialogue character"><p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> I see you've finally decided to relax. Have I ever told you I think
        you lead a very unhealthy life?
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> You've mentioned it.
<p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> Evidently not enough for you to take it to heart. Anyway, the whores
        are quite decent here.
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Maybe some other time.
<p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> You worry me.</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> Here to visit your old friends?
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Just looking around. You?
<p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> A lengthy stay in Henselt's camp and one is likely to become
        somewhat Kaedwenized. I'd like to avoid that.
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Rightly so.</div>

<div class="indent">
   <div class="choice"><span>Have you seen Síle?
   </span></div>
   <div class="dialogue">
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I wonder what Síle's doing in Henselt's camp.
   <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> You're not alone, because she's wondering what you're doing at
           the king's side.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> How do you know?
   <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> She asked me about you.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> What did she want to know?
   <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> I have no idea. I realized right off she was sniffing and told
           her she could smell my fingers if she wanted, but that'd be all
           she'd get.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> And she gave up?
   <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> Mhm. See how careful I am?</div>

   <div class="choice"><span>Have you tried your luck with Ves?
   </span></div>
   <div class="dialogue">
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Have you tried to, uh... approach Ves?
   <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> I've thought about it. On the one hand, I've never rogered a
           soldier, but on the other, the cling-clang of steel against steel
           at an intimate moment could put off even the most attentive lover.
           Why do you ask?
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I just like to know.</div>

   <div class="indent">
      <div class="choice"><span>[If Geralt has dueled Ves]
      </span></div>
      <div class="dialogue">
      <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> I heard you dueled each other.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> You heard right.</div>

      <div class="indent">
         <div class="choice"><span>[If Ves won]
         </span></div>
         <div class="dialogue">
         <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> Be honest, you let her win.
         <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Why would I do that?
         <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> That's what I'd have done. A happy woman is much more
                 willing to drop her knickers.</div>

         <div class="indent">
            <div class="choice"><span>[If Geralt let her win]
            </span></div>
            <div class="dialogue">
            <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Let's just say I didn't fight her like I'd fight Letho.
            <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> I knew it! Did she think to thank you?
            <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> She told me off.
            <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> Tough cookie, that one.</div>

            <div class="choice"><span>[If Ves won legitimately]
            </span></div>
            <div class="dialogue">
            <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I noticed.
            <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> Really? You slept with her?
            <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Mhm.
            <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> And how was she? Spill it!
            <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Well, there was no cling-clang of steel.</div>
         </div>

         <div class="choice"><span>[If Geralt won]
         </span></div>
         <div class="dialogue">
         <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> You came out on top in the arena... Maybe you should try
                 her in, uh, another setting?
         <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Could be interesting, I guess.
         <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> Really? You slept with her?
         <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Mhm.
         <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> And how was she? Spill it!
         <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Well, there was no cling-clang of steel.</div>
      </div>
   </div>

   <div class="choice"><span>Any news about the kingslayer?
   </span></div>
   <div class="dialogue">
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Heard anything about Letho?
   <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> They say he's hiding in the ravines. He's not alone.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I know.
   <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> I fail to comprehend exactly why you have it in for him. He
           escaped. So what? You're no king and as such are hardly in danger.</div>

   <div class="indent">
      <div class="choice"><span>I have to clear my name.
      </span></div>
      <div class="dialogue">
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I'm tired of having to explain that I'm not the kingslayer.
      <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> Henselt believed you.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> But he's still not sure. And I don't want him doing me any
              favors.</div>

      <div class="choice"><span>Letho knows about my past.
      </span></div>
      <div class="dialogue">
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Letho knows a lot about me. There are certain things that
              probably only he can explain.
      <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> I'm not so certain you really want to know them.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> We'll see.</div>

      <div class="choice"><span>I want to know why he kills.
      </span></div>
      <div class="dialogue">
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Letho is responsible for two regicides. I want to know why he
              did it. Or rather, for whom.
      <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> Is that so important?
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Witchers don't step into political quicksand for no reason. I
              don't like the principles that govern the world, but so far
              nobody's come up with anything better. Murdering kings solves
              nothing. Quite the contrary.</div>

      <div class="dialogue">
      <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> Let's say you catch him... What then?</div>

      <div class="indent">
         <div class="choice"><span>I'll kill him.
         </span></div>
         <div class="dialogue">
         <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> First we'll have a talk, then he'll pay for his crime.
         <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> Punishments vary.
         <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> But there's only one punishment for murder.</div>

         <div class="choice"><span>It depends.
         </span></div>
         <div class="dialogue">
         <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I'll decide once I've heard him out, learned the truth. Maybe
                 I'll see his point. Or maybe I'll just cut off his head.</div>
      </div>
   </div>

   <div class="choice"><span>I'm hearing a lot about Sabrina and the battle three years ago.
   </span></div>
   <div class="dialogue">
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Henselt's camp is abuzz with rumors about the events three years ago.
   <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> When you burn a sorceress at the stake, rumors spread faster than
           the seed of a lascivious baron.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I know you primarily value sorceresses for their firm busts, but
           I'm curious – what do you think of Sabrina Glevissig?
   <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> Sorceresses complain about feeling under-appreciated, persecuted,
           even. But lemme tell you, Geralt - you live by the sword, you die
           by the sword. If they didn't meddle, they wouldn't be burned at the
           stake. They keep whining about the horrors that took place on
           Thanedd Island - about the order of the world being destroyed. But
           let me ask you, who brought that about if not them and their
           scheming?</div>

   <div class="choice"><span>I've got a feeling I'll find Yen.
   </span></div>
   <div class="dialogue">
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> My memories and feelings seem inextricably linked. I seem to be
           recovering both... I believe Yennefer's alive and I'll eventually
           find her.
   <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> Triss... Yennefer. That's some life you lead, my friend.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> First off, we have no idea if Yennefer's still alive. Second, we
           have no idea if Triss is alive.
   <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> Hm, true. You seem to have two women, when in fact you don't
           even have one.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Their kind doesn't die easily. I'll find Triss as soon as I've
           dealt with the assassin.
   <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> What about Yennefer?
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I won't know what to do about her until I see her.</div>

   <div class="choice"><span>I now remember pursuing the Wild Hunt.
   </span></div>
   <div class="dialogue">
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> My memory's coming back... It's just bits and pieces so far, but I
           can feel them coming together, forming a whole.
   <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> What have you remembered?
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> A voyage. An endless trek south. I was following Yennefer and the
           Wild Hunt. I have no idea how long. It got cold... Only old people
           were left in the villages I passed through. But they all refused to
           tell me what had happened to the young... To their children...
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I finally pressed a man for information. He blamed it on wolf
           packs, on an outburst of drowners and rotfiends... No one mentioned
           the Wild Hunt.
   <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> Did you catch up to the Hunt?
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I don't know.
   <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> What are you going to do?
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Go on searching. I remember you mentioned some elven poems about the
           Hunt.
   <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> I believe I said they could exist. And they'd be old. I don't
           know any, but look around - you're pretty good at finding things.</div>

   <div class="indent">
      <div class="choice"><span>I found a poem called 'The Song of the Hunt.'
      </span></div>
      <div class="dialogue">
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I found a poem titled "The Song of the Hunt."
      <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> You're kidding!
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Mh-mh. Written by an elven Sage.
      <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> What did he, uh, scribble down?
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> A lot more than I understood. Decipher this for me: "Looking
              glass images without heart or mind haunt the worlds in the name
              of those who have preserved blood from blood, and who feed on
              unrestrained lust."
      <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> The heartless bit is probably about cruelty. But "looking
              glass images?" The Hunt's cruel riders must resemble someone.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> But in a looking glass, they could only resemble themselves.
      <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> Not necessarily. The metaphor might be deeper. In any case,
              somebody commands them. They feed on unrestrained lust - sounds
              like some tyrant.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> There's gotta be some truth behind these convoluted sentences.
              And I wonder why elves are more interested in the Wild Hunt than
              humans.</div>

      <div class="choice"><span>I found the notes of a scholar of the Hunt.
      </span></div>
      <div class="dialogue">
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I found the notes of Morten Collis. He was a scholar - focused
              on studying the Wild Hunt.
      <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> You don't say... Interesting. What's he got in there?
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> The Wild Hunt moves along orthogonal trajectories that accord
              with...
      <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> Chrrr... Zzzzzz....
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> You asleep, Dandelion?
      <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> Sorry, but when I hear words like "trajectories" - yadda-yadda
              something, my eyelids just turn to lead. We can talk about
              poetry, but scholarship? I dunno. Talk to someone who cares...</div>

   <div class="dialogue">
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> The sight of your camp must instill fear in your enemies' hearts.
           I'm certain the stench does.
   <p><span class="tag">HENSELT:</span> Normal military conditions, witcher. Boiling cabbage, stale sweat
           and the smell of fear. They're constant companions in the expansion
           of any great empire.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Thanks for the history lesson. I take it you'll wait until the last
           minute to bring the remaining troops across.
   <p><span class="tag">HENSELT:</span> Nothing sinks defenders' hearts more than steady increases in their
           enemy's ranks. Though I'll say these Vergen sons of bitches are
           worthy foes and won't flee so easily. It's good having a neighbor
           who knows how to fight.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I'm not sure the people of Aedirn share that sentiment.</div>

   <div class="dialogue">
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Dethmold was kind enough to help me - I may be able to lift the
           curse sooner than I thought.
   <p><span class="tag">HENSELT:</span> Details don't interest me. I expect results. That said, master
           Geralt, what would you say to a long-term offer? Protection, for
           instance?
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> If it involves eliminating monsters, then yes.
   <p><span class="tag">HENSELT:</span> That's perfect - my regal person is at all times threatened by
           potential... monsters.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Not the same. I'm ill-suited to being a bodyguard.
   <p><span class="tag">HENSELT:</span> You tread upon a slippery meadow, witcher. Beware - it's strewn
           with the nastiest cow pies. I'm not one to be refused.</div>

   <div class="indent">
      <div class="choice"><span>That's too bad.

      <p><span class="tag">HENSELT:</span> Fine response! I see there's truth in what they say about the
              size of a witcher's privates. I'm glad to see you're no pushover
              and have a mind of your own. If only I had more men of your ilk
              and not the kind of arse-munchers that infest my court!</div>

      <div class="choice"><span>I can't do otherwise.
      </span></div>
      <div class="dialogue">
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> It would run counter to witcher rules, Your Majesty. I don't
              meddle in politics. I agreed to lift the curse, because that's
              a part of my profession.
      <p><span class="tag">HENSELT:</span> And I usually get what I want.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I still refuse. I wouldn't feel comfortable doing it. And a
              bodyguard with moral dilemmas is not likely to provide the best
              protection.
      <p><span class="tag">HENSELT:</span> Seems logical, though I'd even say it contains a hint of a
              threat. Congratulations, witcher, you've managed to piss me off

<div class="dialogue character"><p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> Here to spy on us?
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Who would I be spying for?
<p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> For Henselt. For Dethmold. I heard they hired you.
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> It just so happens we have common aims. But don't worry, observing
        Vernon Roche isn't one of them.
<p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> In that case, to what do I owe this pleasure?</div>

<div class="dialogue"><p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> Greetings, Geralt. What brings you here?</div>

<div class="indent">
   <div class="choice"><span>What are your plans?
   </span></div>
   <div class="dialogue">
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I was wondering what you're actually doing here, Vernon.
   <p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> The Blue Stripes never want for work. Especially in a hotbed like
           this.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> You're not about to tell me, are you. And here I thought we had
           something special.
   <p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> I've got my finger on the pulse. And I've not forgotten what I came
           here for, Geralt.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Foltest's assassin.
   <p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> Precisely. He's holed up like a rat and he'll meet a rat's end.</div>

   <div class="indent">
      <div class="choice"><span>[If Geralt has killed Auckes]
      </span></div>
      <div class="dialogue">
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> He was hiding.
      <p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> I don't follow.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Letho and his witchers tried to kill Henselt. His two accomplices
              were killed, but Letho escaped.</div>
   </div>

   <div class="choice"><span>How's the situation in the camp?
   </span></div>
   <div class="dialogue">
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I've stepped in many mires in my time, but this one seems
           especially deep.
   <p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> I couldn't agree more. Henselt's invasion, an old curse, discord in
           the camp... A right mess.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I wonder what'll come of it.
   <p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> If not for that damned battle of ghosts, Henselt would already be
           ploughing Aedirnian whores.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Three years ago he went home with his tail between his legs and his
           army decimated.
   <p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> He lost to magic, not to an army. And that makes a difference. Say
           all you want about Henselt, but he's the best commander I know. A
           popular uprising won't stop him.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Looks like the Nilfgaardians are supporting him.
   <p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> Shilard's clever that way - does everything to create the impression
           that the party he's negotiating with and the Empire are already
           allies.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I did hear that Kaedwen and Nilfgaard are about to sign a treaty.
   <p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> Huh, they're negotiating. From what I know, the people of Kaedwen
           dislike the idea of an alliance with the Black Ones. As would I.
   <p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> Kaedwen is strong enough without Nilfgaard. Temeria is kingless and
           in turmoil. Things are not well, Geralt. I'd be comforted to see
           Henselt break his teeth on Vergen. But I don't believe some maiden
           can halt him.</div>

   <div class="choice"><span>What's going on in Vergen?
   </span></div>
   <div class="dialogue">
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Any idea what's happening on the other side of the battle of
           specters?
   <p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> I expect not much has changed. A bunch of dwarves, elves and peasants
           are trying to figure out how to save Aedirn.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Saskia's an exceptional woman.
   <p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> But just a woman, nonetheless. Besides – how would you know?</div>

   <div class="indent">
      <div class="choice"><span>[If Geralt has not been across the mists]
      </span></div>
      <div class="dialogue">
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Just a hunch, and there's all the talk. Besides, to assemble an
              army of elves, dwarves and humans who fight side by side, you
              pretty much have to be extraordinary.</div>

      <div class="choice"><span>[If Geralt has been across the mists]
      </span></div>
      <div class="dialogue">
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I've met her.
      <p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> When?
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Henselt sent me over as an envoy.</div>
   </div>

   <div class="dialogue">
   <p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> You'll not persuade me some woman will defeat Henselt in battle.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> You're forgetting one thing - Kaedwen's just fighting for a better
           life, Aedirn's fighting for life itself.
   <p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> Motivation's important, I grant you, but it can't trump knowledge of
           the art of war. Temeria's my only concern. And I'll be glad to see
           Henselt's forces tied up here. That's a good thing.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Think he wouldn't stop after conquering Aedirn? What if he quickly
           deals with Saskia and turns his army west?
   <p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> It's possible. But I hope it won't come to that.</div>

   <div class="choice"><span>Be sure to keep Arnolt well hidden from Dethmold.
   </span></div>
   <div class="dialogue">
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> You need to be careful - Dethmold can't learn that you're holding a
           Kaedweni spy.
   <p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> He won't. Don't you worry none.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Dethmold has an excellent net of his own spies.
   <p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> That spy we caught at Loredo's - Arnolt? He's prancing around in the
           next world.</div>

   <div class="indent">

      <div class="dialogue">
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Why did you kill him?
      <p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> What else was I to do?
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> On the boat, you said he was living proof of Henselt's conspiracy
              against Temeria.
      <p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> I didn't plan it... He just... didn't survive the interrogation.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Maybe you shouldn't've keelhauled him.
      <p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> If he'd been cooperative, I wouldn't have had to.</div>
   </div>

   <div class="dialogue">
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Did he spill anything interesting?
   <p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> He was tough, but waterboarding can be incredibly effective.
           Eventually he coughed up that Henselt was trying to bring the border
           towns to a boil.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Henselt's not stupid. He wouldn't want to wage war on two fronts.
   <p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> That rat Loredo was supposed to stir unrest in Flotsam. Luckily, you
           rearranged his intestines with your blade.</div>

   <div class="choice"><span>Any news about Iorveth?
   </span></div>
   <div class="dialogue">
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> You miss your old friend, Iorveth?
   <p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> If the gods are kind, he'll yet fall into my hands. That said, I
           wonder what the scoundrel's up to.</div>

      <p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> How do you know?
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I met him there.
      <p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> Then so will I. This idea of an assault on Vergen - I like it more
              and more. Iorveth's likely to bruise the Kaedweni army and
              Henselt might wipe out the Squirrels.</div>

   <div class="dialogue">
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> What news of good old Flotsam?
   <p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> Thanks to us, it still is good, old, Temerian Flotsam. If I hadn't
           sniffed out Loredo's treachery, a Kaedweni garrison would be
           stationed there already.
   <p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> Constable John Natalis has appointed a new commandant to Flotsam.
           Let's hope he doesn't turn out to be another whore.</div>

<div class="dialogue character"><p><span class="tag">SÍLE:</span> Greetings Geralt.</div>

<div class="indent">
   <div class="choice"><span>Dethmold doesn't exactly like you.
   </span></div>
   <div class="dialogue">
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> It's pretty obvious you and Dethmold don't exactly get along.
   <p><span class="tag">SÍLE:</span> Dethmold is an overgrown baby - a fine match for King Henselt. The
           problem is that he's as jealous as he is childish. He claims I wish
           to steal his position at the Kaedweni court. Nothing could be more
           absurd.</div>

   <div class="choice"><span>So you decided to stay in the Pontar Valley.
   </span></div>
   <div class="dialogue">
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I'd assumed that after killing the kayran, the Pontar Valley would
           hold no further interest for you.
   <p><span class="tag">SÍLE:</span> You know nothing about me, witcher. I'm here because two northern
           monarchs were murdered. It's quite probable Henselt is next on the
           list. We don't need another country descending into chaos. King
           Henselt cannot die. I'll make sure of that.</div>

   <div class="choice"><span>Triss disappeared along with the assassin.
   </span></div>
   <div class="dialogue">
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Foltest's killer forced Triss to teleport him to Vergen. They're
           somewhere nearby.
   <p><span class="tag">SÍLE:</span> That nosy little meddler Triss used my megascope to accomplish that.
           But I suppose I should be grateful - after all, I might've been the
           kingslayer's victim. Even if Triss is in Vergen, I cannot locate
           her. This damned fog prevents any kind of magical probing.</div>

   <div class="choice"><span>What do you know about the Wild Hunt?
   </span></div>
   <div class="dialogue">
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> A sorceress like you must know bundles about paranormal phenomena.
   <p><span class="tag">SÍLE:</span> Any mage's knowledge has little to do with superstitions.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> The Wild Hunt's no superstition.
   <p><span class="tag">SÍLE:</span> Indeed, the phenomenon exists.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I want to know everything about it. Including what you know.
   <p><span class="tag">SÍLE:</span> You're out of luck. I've never concerned myself with it. I'm also
           not interested in whirlwinds or hailstorms.</div>

   <div class="indent">
      <div class="choice"><span>I found the notes of a scholar of the Hunt.
      </span></div>
      <div class="dialogue">
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I have proof suggesting that the Wild Hunt is a vast accumulation
              of the Power. Strange that mages aren't interested.
      <p><span class="tag">SÍLE:</span> To the mere mortal, anything that is not immediately
              comprehensible is suspect, the product of a conspiracy. And
              where there's a conspiracy, well, it's obvious mages must have
              hatched it.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I'm a mortal, though probably not a "mere" one. I found the
              notes of a man who spent his entire life...
      <p><span class="tag">SÍLE:</span> Try the apothecary. Paranormal phenomena apparently interest him.
              Perhaps he'll satisfy your thirst.</div>

      </div>

      <div class="choice"><span>We'll come back to that.
      </span></div>
      <div class="dialogue">
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> We'll talk about that later.</div>

   <div class="choice"><span>I've got this tattoo I want to get rid of.
   </span></div>
   <div class="dialogue">
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Know how to remove a tattoo?

   <p><span class="tag">VES:</span> Possibly... Henselt keeps the precise plans of his campaign a secret.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Why haven't you set up in the Kaedweni camp? Information becomes

           or he's their next target.

           Kaedwen and Aedirn have been disputing it for generations. Only
           now, Temeria and Aedirn are kingless.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> True, Henselt might profit from the deaths of Foltest and Demavend,
           but covert assassinations aren't his style.
   <p><span class="tag">VES:</span> I suppose you're right. The Kaedweni king seems to love a good war.
           Just take a look around. Perhaps that's his ruse. When the cheese
           goes missing from the larder, no one thinks of blaming the cat...

         <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> First and foremost, Collis looked into the Hunt's movement,
                 its direction.
         <p><span class="tag">MYRON:</span> The Wild Hunt moves from north to south, always, never in the

         <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Mhm. That's what I remember, and Collis confirms it. I just
                 don't understand why that is.
         <p><span class="tag">MYRON:</span> By virtue of its trajectory, the cavalcade slips into our

         <div class="dialogue">
         <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> According to the notes, the Hunt's arrival can be predicted
                 by observing the Orkan nebula.
         <p><span class="tag">MYRON:</span> Solar eclipses affect how frequently it appears. Whereas it
                 invariably makes its advent on the winter solstice - though
                 not every year.
         <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Collis calculated that the Hunt appears in those years when

         <p><span class="tag">MYRON:</span> It's an awkward topic. Since the Council and Conclave banned
                 the use of mind spells, it has almost been taboo to speak of
                 the Wild Hunt.
         <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Think there's a connection between the retinue and mental
                 spells?
         <p><span class="tag">MYRON:</span> Both seem to addle the brain. All who have dealt with the Hunt
                 seem mentally unstable. Many have gone mad, others have
                 experienced amnesia. The specters emit a magnetic field that

         <p><span class="tag">MYRON:</span> That's pure coincidence. The Hunt arrives in the winter, and
                 most campaigns begin in spring.</div>

         <div class="choice"><span>Let's summarize.
         </span></div>
         <div class="dialogue">
         <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Let's summarize...
         <p><span class="tag">MYRON:</span> Through his observations and by calculating the retinue's
                 trajectory of movement, Collis formulated two equivalent
                 conclusions. The first states that the Wild Hunt are knights
                 who perished in different worlds and have assembled as a
                 cavalcade of vengeance.
         <p><span class="tag">MYRON:</span> His second hypothesis is that some unknown and powerful force
                 multiplies the specters whose task is to move between worlds
                 and capture slaves. Both theories seem probable.
         <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> If an encounter with the Hunt and its magnetic field addles
                 the mind, then a second encounter should reverse those
                 effects.
         <p><span class="tag">MYRON:</span> Indeed, someone who lost their sanity or memory to the Wild
                 Hunt could be healed upon meeting the cavalcade again. But
                 that is pure speculation. Anyone who's succeeded in escaping
                 the wraiths' grasp would rather perish than see them again.
         <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> So, the Wild Hunt could cause you to lose your memory, but it
                 could also help you get it back...
         <p><span class="tag">MYRON:</span> Might you know something I don't?
         <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I have amnesia. But for some time now, memories have been
                 coming back.
         <p><span class="tag">MYRON:</span> Do you recall when this began?
         <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Mhm. Right after I killed a certain specter - the King of the
                 Wild Hunt.</div>
