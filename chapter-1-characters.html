<p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> I never thought some local swill in some faraway hole could taste so good. The world looks different from atop a scaffold, lemme tell ya. But risks come with the job.
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Right, poetry's a risky business.
<p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> Laugh all you want, Geralt, but I'm talking about the daily dilemmas of a secret agent of His Royal Majesty.
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Did Roche recruit you?
<p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> I travel as a matter of course, and the crown pays me well for information from neighboring kingdoms. Let's just say I've placed my personal safety as a sacrifice on the altar of my motherland.
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Will you ever learn? You're no good at this. Are you even Temerian?
<p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> I put my talents to the best possible use. And money, my friend, don't stink. Besides, if I tried to back out now, they'd probably arrest and hang me.
</div>
<div class="indent">
   <div class="choice"><span>Talk. I can tell you want to.
   </span></div>
   <div class="dialogue">
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I know you - I can see you're dying to ask me. What is it?
   <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> All right, fess up. What happened to Foltest?</div>
<div class="indent">
      <div class="choice"><span>He pissed off the Scoia'tael.
      </span></div>
      <div class="dialogue"><p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> The King's dead, and the Scoia'tael are in it up to the tips of their pointed ears.
      <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> Yada, yada. The Scoia'tael are blamed for everything in this country, from bad crops to bad marital sex.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I was there. I saw it. The assassin escaped with the help of Scoia'tael.
      <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> Hm, I guess the price on Iorveth's head will rise.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Loredo's sensed that already. If he can catch Iorveth...
      <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> Fertilized by the elf's rotting corpse, his career will blossom, somewhere far away from this dump.</div>

      <div class="choice"><span>I was framed.
      </span></div>
      <div class="dialogue">
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Want to know the version that has yet to make it to Flotsam? The King died in mysterious circumstances. The witcher Geralt, his sword covered in blood, was discovered standing over his corpse.
      <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> Did you kill him? This'll stay between us, I promise...
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> The killer escaped before I could get him. I'm being set up.
      <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> So what're you gonna do? Run around, swinging your sword, hoping the killer walks into range?
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I don't have to. The killer's in the forest with the Scoia'tael, and he knows I'm here. We'll find each other.
      <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> Geralt, please don't do anything stupid. Don't stick your neck out. If Loredo finds out you were involved in Foltest's assassination... Ugh.</div>
</div>
   <div class="choice"><span>What did you put in that report you gave Roche?
   </span></div>
   <div class="dialogue"><p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> You gave Vernon a full report on Flotsam. Seen anything unusual around here?
   <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> They've got some amazing women at the brothel - you should take a look. One of them...
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> You know what I mean.
   <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> A town like any other. It's got a harbor, an inn and a stinking, muddy river. That's what an ordinary man would say. But we poets also look into people's souls. And things are not good. I saw a robbery sanctioned by law, town watchmen laughing as they "confiscated" goods, all the while talking about how they'd finally bring order to the town. I saw drunken thugs beat up an elf woman while no one even flinched.
   <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> I know these things happen everywhere, but here, it's not motivated by hatred or misguided attempts at meting out justice. People are driven by cold calculation. They're always looking for opportunities to get a little richer.</div>

   <div class="choice"><span>Have you learned anything about the assassinations?
   </span></div>
   <div class="dialogue"><p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I need information, anything that could help me track down the kingslayers.
   <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> I only know gossip - things folk have been saying since Demavend's death. People are throwing out blame left and right. One day it's the elves, another the Nilfgaardians, then it's Rivians...
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Lemme guess - the suspects also include a Zerrikanian alchemist. And a group of halflings...
   <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> Bold theory, that, but the mob comes up with even better ones. Know what? Frankly, the most worrying effect of these assassinations is the chaos they've unleashed in people's minds.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> What do you mean?
   <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> I mean chaos. People don't know what to think - who's good and who's evil. And these are tough times. Who knows what's going to happen.</div>

   <div class="choice"><span>So, master spy, politics - care to give me your assessment?
   </span></div>
   <div class="dialogue"><p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> So, mister master spy, what's new in the world of politics? Bards singing about anything interesting these days?
   <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> Aedirn's in trouble. Henselt and his great army are nearing the Pontar and will ford it and strike any day.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Well, we haven't had a war in a long time.
   <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> Like all little boys, he likes to play with his soldiers. But I don't think Kaedwen'll have an easy time of it. Aedirn's borders are guarded by Saskia the Dragonslayer.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Who's she? Some mercenary?
   <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> A peasant girl and self-proclaimed commander of something called the Aedirnian Voluntary Militia.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Fighting women and bards who play politics. These are strange times...</div>

   <div class="choice"><span>My memory's coming back.
   </span></div>
   <div class="dialogue"><p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I'm having flashbacks, Dandelion.
   <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> What've you remembered?
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> My own death.
   <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> I saw that with my own eyes, as I've told you many times. Yennefer gave her life to save yours. I thought you might've remembered what happened afterwards. I mean, how the devil can you be here now? I hear you, I see you... You're breathing, I mean, you're just alive.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Dandelion, I've had a flashback or two. I don't know everything yet.
</div>
   <div class="choice"><span>I found a manuscript about the Wild Hunt.
   </span></div>
   <div class="dialogue"><p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> The Wild Hunt's not a legend - I can prove it.
   <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> How so?
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I found a manuscript whose authors contend that our world is not the only one where there's life. They also believe stars are not just twinkling points.
   <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> You want to tell me that somewhere up there, I'd find other Geralts, other Dandelions, living, breathing and...? Shame we can't meet up.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Exactly. The manuscript says vast distances are the main problem - a normal human would run out of lifetime before he got to any of those other worlds.
   <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> Besides which he'd have to have something that could fly.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> The manuscript's authors claims the Wild Hunt has found solutions to both problems. The cavalcade travels between the worlds.
   <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> Sounds a little like the ravings of a drunk dwarf, but who knows...
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I need to find out. The manuscript mentions someone named Morten Collis, who devoted his life to observing the Hunt. Maybe I can get my hands on his research.</div>

   <div class="choice"><span>I've been to the Isle of Avallach.
   </span></div>
   <div class="dialogue"><p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I now remember the Isle of Avallach, where Ciri took Yennefer and me... It was a joyous time... Until the Wild Hunt's riders appeared. They abducted Yennefer...
   <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> Sure you didn't dream this?
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I dream of the Wild Hunt every night. But these were not illusions, hallucinations.
   <p><span class="tag">DANDELION:</span> I'm not sure how to help you. There must've been someone who studied the Wild Hunt, though from what I can remember, human literature is pretty much silent about it. There's always elven literature - I don't know that too well, so maybe it's worth some delving...</div>

<div class="dialogue character"><p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> What's going on, Geralt?</div>
<div class="indent">
   <div class="choice"><span>[If Geralt hasn't gone to Loredo's compound]
   What now? Got a plan?
   </span></div>
   <div class="dialogue"><p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> We arrived in Flotsam, we saw the killer, we've pissed everyone off. What next?
   <p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> If the kingslayer's in Iorveth's care, we'll have to get them both.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> If we go out into that forest to look for elves, all we'll find is our own death.
   <p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> We'll visit Loredo as invited. He may be a hick heading a bunch of imbeciles, but this is his territory and he could prove useful.</div>

   <div class="choice"><span>We're wasting time. The kingslayer will escape.
   </span></div>
   <div class="dialogue"><p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> You'll get a chance to show your mettle. If we're to capture Foltest's murderer, we'll have to clash with the Scoia'tael.
   <p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> I sent the boys out into the woods. Tough going, too dense. My scouts got ambushed and barely escaped.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> It's no picnic hunting elves in the forest - tell me something I don't know.
   <p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> My people saw the kingslayer again. He knows we're here but he's not even trying to escape. Seems he's waiting for something.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I think it's our move.</div>

   <div class="choice"><span>Looks like you're on Loredo's shit list.
   </span></div>
   <div class="dialogue"><p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> How can the commander of a Temerian garrison just piss all over the commander of Foltest's special forces?
   <p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> The Blue Stripes aren't exactly popular among common folk, in case you hadn't noticed.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Like anyone who does the dirty work. But Loredo's a soldier...
   <p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> The worst scum gets posted to dumpy border towns like this. Incompetent fools who show off their authority to a bunch of grimy peasants.</div>

   <div class="choice"><span>Loredo's up to something big.
   </span></div>
   <div class="dialogue"><p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Loredo wants the Scoia'tael gone for good. He didn't say anything specific, but in his mind's eye he saw them on the prison barge already.
   <p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> Iorveth's outsmarted bigger fish than the commandant.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Loredo's got something going with Síle, so I'd take him seriously if I were you.
   <p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> You never know, maybe the sorceress hunts more than monsters.</div>

   <div class="choice"><span>I spoke to Iorveth's deputy commander.
   </span></div>
   <div class="dialogue"><p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I questioned Ciaran, Iorveth's second in command.
   <p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> Where is the bastard?
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I get the feeling he's dead, just landed on the Isle of Avallach. I've been to that island, Vernon. I remembered something while talking to Ciaran. I was there with Yennefer. She gave her life to save mine.
   <p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> Did you remember the crossing, how you got there?
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> With Ciri's help...
   <p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> Interesting...
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> What I find interesting is how a master spook like you has no idea what happened to me over those five years. Five years, Roche. That's enough time to topple a monarchy, twice.
   <p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> First off, my responsibilities do not include the surveillance of dead witchers. And second...
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Spit it out.
   <p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> Unconfirmed rumors - I've never taken action based on them.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I need something, scraps even. So you need to tell me everything you know. Even things you think might sound ridiculous.
   <p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> Three years back, Fenn got a missing persons case. Someone was abducting young people, aged ten to twenty. Ugh, the case went cold because no one agreed to testify. Except for one woman, considered insane because she insisted the Wild Hunt had made off with her son. And she claimed she'd learned of this from an old man who was pursuing the cavalcade. He resembled a skeleton more than a man - white hair, two swords on his back.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> The Wild Hunt is a riddle. A riddle that will restore my memory - if I can just solve it.
   <p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> As I see it, you're more likely to learn about the Hunt from the insane. Not a reasonable man out there can teach you a thing. You might visit that asylum in the woods - or what's left of it.</div>
<div class="indent"><div class="indent">
         <div class="choice"><span>[If Cedric is dead]
         </span></div>
         <div class="dialogue"><p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Recovering my memory - that's in your interest, too.
         <p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> I'll never fall for that - too simple.
         <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Before he died, Cedric told me that once I'd recovered my memory, I'd understand who was behind the royal slayings. Including that of your king, Roche.
         <p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> The ravings of a drunken elf.
         <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Sorry you see it that way.</div>
</div>
      <div class="choice"><span>I found a patient's chart.
      </span></div>
      <div class="dialogue"><p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I found a patient's chart in the ruins of the hospital.
      <p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> You mean the burned down insane asylum?
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> They committed him to the asylum because he had insisted he'd been a prisoner of the Wild Hunt. He claimed he'd been in a world without humans, where he'd seen herds of unicorns. He managed to return to our world after a year, only to find his children had died of old age... Following this, Vernon? It means he'd been to a world where time flows a lot slower...</div>
</div>
   <div class="choice"><span>I have the notes of a madman who claimed he'd been abducted by the Hunt.
   </span></div>
   <div class="dialogue"><em>[Same as "I found a patient's chart" above.]</em></div>

   <div class="choice"><span>Flotsam's in the wilderness. It's a good hideout.
   </span></div>
   <div class="dialogue"><p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> A little town deep in the forest, terrorized by Scoia'tael. You should be in your element, Roche.
   <p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> Flotsam isn't just any old town, Geralt. Temeria, Redania, Kaedwen and Aedirn - the largest kingdoms in the North. Know what they all have in common?
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> The Pontar Valley. A strip of land they've been battling over for generations.
   <p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> Exactly. And here's Flotsam. On the border between Temeria and Aedirn, with Kaedwen lying in wait just the other side of the marshes.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> At the very edge of the Pontar Valley.
   <p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> Stuck in the middle like a candle up the arse.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> The North's most important trade routes meet here. Every caravan has to come through Flotsam, and anyone who wants to place their cargo on a boat on this section of the river has to bear Loredo in mind.
   <p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> They say Henselt of Kaedwen has gathered an army and is heading for Vergen. The Pontar Valley will be on fire soon. While we, Geralt, are sitting in Flotsam, the gateway to the valley.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I'd like to believe it's pure coincidence and the killer just followed the Squirrels here.
   <p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> Naïve, to say the least, witcher.</div>

   <div class="choice"><span>[EXIT] See you later.
   </span></div>
   <div class="dialogue"><p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> So long, Roche.</div>

   <div class="choice"><span>Everything all right?
   </span></div>
   <div class="dialogue"><p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> How's it living with Roche's soldiers?
   <p><span class="tag">TRISS:</span> Splendid. I know every shit joke that anyone's ever thought up, plus
           I've learned how to burp out the official title of the Emperor of
           Nilfgaard without reaching for beer.
   <p><span class="tag">TRISS:</span> Shorty's told me about his sixteen children - all named after
           Temerian troop divisions - and I know his nickname has nothing to
           do with his manhood. Nice to know you that you care, though.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Glad to see you in a good mood.
   <p><span class="tag">TRISS:</span> I think I actually like them. They're good people. One of them even
           proposed to me.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Who's the brave man?
   <p><span class="tag">TRISS:</span> Hm, sorry, that's a secret.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> And here I thought Roche's boys had an ounce of respect for me.</div>

   <div class="choice"><span>[If kayran is alive] Are you scared of De Tansarville?
   </span></div>
   <div class="dialogue"><p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Did you go pale when you saw Síle or did I imagine that?
   <p><span class="tag">TRISS:</span> I don't like her.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> It's that simple...?
   <p><span class="tag">TRISS:</span> She has no human feelings, she's cold, ruthless and painfully
           logical. She once forced me to make a decision I regret to this day.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I need her help to kill the kayran. Then she'll go her way, and
           we'll go ours.
   <p><span class="tag">TRISS:</span> I hope so. Watch out for yourself in the meantime.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Don't worry, wild beasts are my specialty.
   <p><span class="tag">TRISS:</span> Not sorceresses?
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Same thing.</div>

   <div class="choice"><span>[If kayran is alive] Can you help me with the kayran?
   </span></div>
   <div class="dialogue"><p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> If you helped me draw the kayran out of the water, I wouldn't have
           to ask Síle.
   <p><span class="tag">TRISS:</span> I don't know the right spells. I've never dealt with monsters.
   <p><span class="tag">TRISS:</span> Geralt, couldn't you just leave this one monster alone? There must be
           some other way to rip Dandelion and Zoltan out of Loredo's hands.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Wait a second... What is it, Triss? She's just one more conceited
           sorceress.
   <p><span class="tag">TRISS:</span> Sorry, I'm not sure myself... I've got a feeling I've been deceived
           and manipulated by sorceresses I trust.</div>
<div class="indent">
      <div class="choice"><span>Is Síle one of those sorceresses?
      </span></div>
      <div class="dialogue"><p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Is Síle one of them?
      <p><span class="tag">TRISS:</span> I think so, but I can't be certain.
      <p><span class="tag">TRISS:</span> It's complicated, Geralt. I need some time.</div>

      <div class="choice"><span>Want to tell me something?

      <div class="dialogue"><p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> You want to talk or not?
      <p><span class="tag">TRISS:</span> No... Yes... Oh, I don't know. I need some time.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> You have a think, and I'll deal with the kayran.</div>
</div>
   <div class="choice"><span>Seems my memory's coming back.
   </span></div>
   <div class="dialogue"><p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> The massacre in Rivia - it came back to me, I remember. The angry
           mob murdering nonhumans, a young boy with a pitchfork.
   <p><span class="tag">TRISS:</span> Anything else?
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Death... Or a state close to it, I'm not sure. I felt life draining
           out of me.
   <p><span class="tag">TRISS:</span> Um, I was there. I arrived a moment later, too late...
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Don't worry, Triss. They're only memories. We have bigger problems
           to tackle, now. Something tells me that in recovering my memory,

           don't think she's gettin' anywhere with it. Got so enraged one time

           remember the Conjunction of the Spheres, but it'll do for weapon
           repairs. They also enhance swords with runes and add ornamentation
           to armor. Just don't do anything that'll make you look like
           Dandelion at the opening of a new brothel. You could also look in
           on some merchants. I don't think Loredo's robbed them of everything

   <p><span class="tag">ZOLTAN:</span> Heard it by chance. Saw him walking through the port one night,
           talking to himself, the batty bastard. He mentioned a new order
           and a world for humans only. He laughed and shouted curses at the
           prison barge. The scum is up to something. Iorveth must sense it.
           He's doing everything not to provoke Loredo, but his Scoia'tael
           might have a different opinion. And less restraint.</div>
