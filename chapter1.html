        hereby declare a state of emergency. Await orders, prepare to fight,
        and ready yourselves to avenge your fallen king. Now disperse, go to
        your homes.

<div class="indent">
   Dandelion and Zoltan are free?
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   GERALT: What about them?
   LOREDO: They'll not hang for now. Let's say I'm reconsidering their cases...
           The scaffold's no place for civil conversation. We'll talk at my
           home. Your friends are free for the time being, but they're not to
           leave town.
   LOREDO: Come after dusk. Hm, I'll be busy until then. There's one more
           thing...
   LOREDO: Welcome to Flotsam, witcher.

   Nice show.
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   GERALT: Nice speech. You might as well have said outright that nonhumans
           slew Foltest...
   LOREDO: My subjects know exactly who their enemy is. Out in that forest,
           grow careless for a moment and you're a dead man.
   GERALT: Whereas the nonhumans here in town are all friendly.
   LOREDO: Friendlier than the merciless bastards out there. We let the
           Scoia'tael inside and they'll skin us alive, just before they slit
           our throats. Here, even the slightest sense of safety is an illusion.
           We'll not succumb to it for a moment.
   [Continues the same as "Dandelion and Zoltan are free?"]
</div>

[Dandelion and Zoltan are freed from the nooses.]

DANDELION: Ah. They were really going to hang us. I... I... I don't know...
        I didn't mean to torch that watchtower.
GERALT: Everything's all right, Dandelion. Let's get out of here.
ZOLTAN: Oh we owe, we owe you, Geralt. Thank you.
ZOLTAN: Time to hit the tavern. Come on, Dandelion, you need a stiff drink.
        And while we're at it, I'll tell you an edifying tale of local
        hypocrisy that conceals lechery 'neath a veneer of courtesy. Except
        nothing can hide the stench.

[Geralt joins his friends in the tavern.]

DANDELION: Ha-hah! Damn, that was close... Innkeep! Vodka!
ZOLTAN: Triss Merigold! Lice eat me, but you are a treat to behold! Ah, just a
        little pale...
TRISS: Magic takes its toll, but I'll be all right. Good to see you and your
        beard again.
GERALT: Can somebody tell me what happened? You set off a month ago for
        Zoltan's wedding...
ZOLTAN: That got fucked. There will be no wedding.
GERALT: Did you hear about Foltest?
DANDELION: Rumors travel faster than the wind.
ZOLTAN: Winds and rumors! I want to know the truth.
DANDELION: I want to know how Foltest died. And the dragon - was there really
        one there? And who rules Temeria now?
GERALT: Dandelion, calm down - you'll choke on your liquor.

   The dragon...
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   GERALT: The dragon... Well, the dragon appeared, and that's all I know.
   DANDELION: But where did the La Valettes get a dragon?! We heard it fought
           on their side! Huge as a barn, they say.
   GERALT: Dragons don't usually take sides. Maybe its lair was nearby and it
           just felt threatened.
   TRISS: If you hadn't driven it off, Foltest might not have taken the castle.
   GERALT: Maybe. We'll never know for sure.

   What's with the wedding, Zoltan?
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   GERALT: No wedding, Zoltan?
   ZOLTAN: Hah! The Breckenriggs broke off the engagement because some limp
           prick put it about that I joined the uprising in Vizima. My would-be
           pop-in-law refused to let a rebel firebrand join the family...
           Innkeep! Where's our drink?!
   DANDELION: It was like this... We got to Mahakam a week after the Grand
           Master died. Bought Zoltan an absolutely grand doublet, a pair of
           Geribuldi crackowes and, as a gift for Eudora, a jadestone as big as
           my fist.
   ZOLTAN: We were broke as a joke by the time Dandelion threw me a bachelor
           party at an establishment called 'The Tight Lane.'
   DANDELION: Next day we went over to the Breckenriggs'. They welcomed us in,
           sat us down, and proceeded to discuss the superiority of Mahakaman
           mining know-how over any other. And that went on until dinner. Just
           when I thought I'd learned more than I ever wanted to know about
           mining, they served the soup...
   ZOLTAN: You could've heard a pin drop. Old Breckenrigg rose and he says, 'A
           real dwarf works a mine, not chases fame on the battlefield.'
   DANDELION: You'll never believe this, Geralt, but they served duck blood
           soup! It was as black as tar. They must've dropped lumps of coal
           into the pot.
   ZOLTAN: Eat,' Breckenrigg says, then proceeded to slurp two full bowls of
           the shite. Old goat. Hope his mine caves in on his head.

      Dandelion, since when have you worked for Roche?
      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
      GERALT: Since when have you worked for Roche?
      DANDELION: Hey, nobody said a word when you went out to save Temeria
              from the Grand Master and his mutants.
      GERALT: Relax, Dandelion. I was just asking. Do what you want. You're an
              adult... kind of.
      ZOLTAN: Bua-ha-ha-ha-haaaaa-ha!
      TRISS: That wasn't very supportive.
      DANDELION: Laugh away... At least I decided to do something constructive.
      GERALT: You used to spy for Redania, now you're spying for Temeria. Some
              might call you a traitor.
      DANDELION: Ever tried to live off of poetry alone? The truth is, I'm a
              citizen of the world. As long as I don't serve Emperor Emhyr,
              I'm not doing any harm.
      ZOLTAN: Leave him be, Geralt. He'll play the spy a bit, get bored, and
              drop it. You know how he is.

      Have you joined the Scoia'tael, Zoltan?
      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
      GERALT: Loredo said you're working with the Scoia'tael, Zoltan.
      ZOLTAN: I have done many things in my life, Geralt, but I've never
              stooped to banditry.
      GERALT: The Scoia'tael don't consider themselves bandits.
      ZOLTAN: But I am no Scoia'tael.

   Triss, tell us what happened after I was arrested.
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   GERALT: Triss, you're the expert on Temeria... tell us who's in charge now.
   TRISS: It's chaotic and getting worse. The old families are fighting for
           supremacy, no holds barred.
   DANDELION: Baron Kimbolt and Count Maravel, I bet...
   TRISS: Among others. After the assassination, while Geralt was in the
           dungeon, the lords convened in a field near La Valette Castle to
           choose a new ruler. Three days they debated and it looked more like
           a bazaar than a meeting of nobles. Except the trade was in court
           and ministry positions, spheres of influence, royal privileges...
   ZOLTAN: Thah! Humans!
   TRISS: In spite of several duels and two poisonings, no king was chosen.
           Civil war was in the air.

      No mages around to cool things down?
      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
      GERALT: Where were the mages?
      ZOLTAN: Aye! Where were the gray eminences of this world when they were
              truly needed?
      TRISS: They weren't invited. Neither was I. But if not for their
              intervention, or rather that of a few influential sorceresses,
              Baron Kimbolt would've taken the throne...
      DANDELION: I was invited to sing at his court once. Afterwards, he
              refused to pay me, and the food was awful. No way I'll stay in
              Temeria if he's crowned.

      Was there any resolution?
      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
      GERALT: Did they ultimately resolve anything?
      TRISS: No. It ended as usual...Sadly, John Natalis remains our only hope.
      DANDELION: Ah, the victor at Brenna and Foltest's most tried and true
              field commander.
      TRISS: Hmm. During the deliberations, he was several days' march from La
              Valette lands - with an additional two thousand armed men in tow.
              He's to keep the peace until a  rightful monarch is chosen.
      DANDELION: He could find that ruling is to his liking.
      TRISS: Natalis is a soldier at heart. He's not suited to rule and I don't
              believe he even wants to.
      ZOLTAN: He's got the army behind him...
      TRISS: Which is why he can guarantee peace. A tenuous one, sure, but
              that's always better than civil war. Besides which, he's deeply
              in debt to a dwarven bank in which Philippa Eilhart, a sorceress,
              holds a significant stake.

      That's enough politics.
      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         About the King...
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         GERALT: Foltest's killer lay in wait in the tower where the La
                 Valettes had hidden the royal bastards. He was well-informed.
         DANDELION: Wait a minute. What were you doing there?
         GERALT: I was protecting the King. After the first attempt, Foltest
                 began treating me as his lucky charm. He ordered me to be at
                 his side during the battle. The dragon separated us from the
                 rest of the army. The killer disguised himself as a monk, a
                 blind one at that. He let Foltest greet his children, waited
                 until I had walked off, then cut the king's throat from ear to
                 ear.
         ZOLTAN: How did he flee?
         GERALT: Jumped out a window into the river below. Iorveth's Scoia'tael
                 were waiting in a boat - it was planned.
         DANDELION: And you're chasing him because he murdered the King?
         GERALT: I was accused of the murder. I need to clear my name. Besides,
                 I looked him in the eye before he escaped... He's a witcher.
                 Then some brave Temerian soldiers showed up, piled on me, and
                 knocked me out...

[A man bursts into the tavern.]

MAN: Save yourselves, good folk! The beast attacks!
TRISS: We better get out there... Someone's casting spells.

[A tentacle writhes around the docks, striking bystanders. A mage casts a
   lightning spell at it, and it retreats.]

DOCK WORKER: What sort of sorceress are you?! A lot of good you did. Can't you
        hear me?! Why didn't you help him?
SHEALA: He's alive, isn't he?
DOCK WORKER: The beast nearly pulled him in the water, while you stood staring
        like a calf at a shit-covered clover!
SHEALA: Watch your words.

[Geralt and Triss approach.]

GERALT: Where's this beast?
DOCK WORKER: Ask her!
SHEALA: Geralt?
GERALT: Ah, I guess we knew each other.
DOCK WORKER: Oh, lookey here, birds of a feather...
SHEALA: Let's say... I've heard of you.
DOCK WORKER: Master witcher, this is foolish. The beast near pulled Sosek into
        the depths, and you're simply chatting with this damsel!

   Butt out. Sosek's alive, isn't he?
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   GERALT: Sosek's alive and nowhere near the depths. The monster's vanished
           without a trace.
   DOCK WORKER: You best take us seriously, lest you vanish without a trace.

      Right. About the monster...
      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
      GERALT: All right. What happened?
      SHEALA: I came to Flotsam to kill the kayran.
      DOCK WORKER 2: Kayran?
      SHEALA: The monster that has effectively blocked the port. A moment ago,
              I had the good fortune to see it in all its splendor, but the
              local folk scared it away.
      DOCK WORKER 3: Good fortune? You hear that, Sosek? That was some good
              fortune for you!
      DOCK WORKER 2: Why's the beast in the port all of a sudden, eh? Summoned
              by the witch, perchance?
      DOCK WORKER 1: To see it in all its splendor!

         Care to fight the monster yourselves?
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         GERALT: And which of you is ready to help the sorceress fight the
                 beast?
         DOCK WORKER 2: Why us? Huge it is! Big as a mountain!
         GERALT: Then why get angry at someone who's willing?
         DOCK WORKER 2: Well, 'cause...
         GERALT: We'll tend to the kayran, the sorceress or I. Maybe we'll do
                 it together. We'll draw it away from the port beforehand, so
                 as not to endanger the likes of you.
         DOCK WORKER 1: Well, I hope you succeed. I've no preference for who
                 does it - witch or witcher... just kill the whoreson and the
                 whole town will be grateful.

         [INTIMIDATION] Get out of my face.
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         GERALT: I'm tired of your whining. Get out of here.

            [FAILURE]
            DOCK WORKER 1: I'm to go? Not likely. You get your arse out of
                    Flotsam, wanderer!

            [SUCCESS]
            DOCK WORKER 1: Ah, as ever, it's the common folk that get ploughed.
                    Come on, lads.
            DOCK WORKER 2: *Ptooey!*

         [AXII] You need to get Sosek out of here.
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         GERALT: Sosek doesn't look too good. Lay him inside somewhere.

            [FAILURE]
            DOCK WORKER 1: Oh, you tryin' that black magic on me? Come on,
                    lads, this sorcerer's eager for a thrashin'!

            [SUCCESS]
            DOCK WORKER 1: Right, we've dawdled enough already. Come on, lads,
                    let's go.
            DOCK WORKER 3: What's this? I was ready for a rumble, there.
            DOCK WORKER 1: Shut it, and come on.

   Tell me about the monster...
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   [Same as "Right. About the monster..."]

[A man in fine clothing approaches.]

MERSE: I apologize for interrupting, but I am Louis Merse, and I am chief
       person in charge of all matters related to monster-hunting in Flotsam.
       It is in this capacity that I must inquire if you're willing to attempt
       to resolve the problem of our so-called kayran - the beast that now
       blocks all trade traffic on the river.
SHEALA: So, witcher? Are we willing?
GERALT: I usually work alone...
SHEALA: I was here first, and I'll not relinquish this contract. My way or the
        highway, as the locals put it...
GERALT: Fine, your way it is.
MERSE: You must contact the merchants on the waterfront as regards any rewards.
        Madame De Tansarville has, I believe, already conducted some
        preliminary negotiations...
SHEALA: That, I have.
MERSE: In that case, don't let me keep you.

[Merse leaves.]

SHEALA: Triss, how long must I wait for you to introduce us?
TRISS: Síle de Tansarville, advisor to Queen Zulika of Kovir.
GERALT: Kovir's a long way north.
SHEALA: True. I had my doubts if the kayran was worth the journey, but those
        were dispelled with what it showed today.
TRISS: Here to hunt down some ingredients?
SHEALA: Triss Merigold - sharp as ever.
GERALT: You're thinking that...?
SHEALA: Troll eyes, ghoul venom, virgins' blood... All those disgusting
        marvels we take from dying species... To throw into the cauldron at
        sabbaths. Right, Triss?
TRISS: Absolutely - virgins are a dying breed.
SHEALA: Oh my! Your sense of humor seems to be intact, too. But enough of
        these pleasantries. Tell me, Geralt: you saw the tentacle - what do
        you make of it all?
GERALT: The beast must be huge. Maybe inhabited one of the Pontar's tributaries
        before, hunting animals... Then it grew for some reason and hunger
        drove it to seek fresh pastures.
SHEALA: And on the Pontar it found trade barges burgeoning with obese,
        slow-moving merchants. You're partly correct. Cedric claims the
        kayran emerged from the northern swamps approximately one month past.

   [If Cedric hasn't been met yet]
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   GERALT: Cedric?
   SHEALA: An elf... Formerly a Scoia'tael. Strange bird, but he knows quite a
           bit about the area and its living wonders.

GERALT: I need to look around, find out a few things...
SHEALA: Hm, an investigation, witchers' rituals, extracting secrets and such...
GERALT: More or less. I'll talk to the merchants about the reward, pay Cedric
        a visit and get back to you...
SHEALA: You'll find me at the inn. I've rented lodgings there - on the upper
        floor.
TRISS: You know the inn's also a whorehouse.
SHEALA: Thanks for the warning.
