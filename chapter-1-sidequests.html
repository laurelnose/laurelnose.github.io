        riff-raff. Believe you me, I know what I'm talking about.
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> So? I don't know you.
<p><span class="tag">ZIGGY:</span> They call me King Ziggy. Because I pay like a king. If you want a taste
        of fame and riches, look for me by the inn in the evenings. I'll take
        you to the right place.

        four, and some say he can hang a bucket full of water from his cock.

   <div class="dialogue">
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Gimme the details.
   <p><span class="tag">ZIGGY:</span> Only once you've made your mind up, my friend. For now, you'll have
           to make do with the lure of fame and coin. Or, you can going on
           wasting your talents beating the dust out of drunkards around
           the inns.

<p><span class="tag">ZIGGY:</span> Know what Flotsam's famous for?
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Nothing?
<p><span class="tag">ZIGGY:</span> You're wrong, there. There are only two towns worth visiting in the
        Pontar Valley. Bondar, famous for having the most beautiful whores
        in the North, and Flotsam, for having the best fist fighting scene.
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Who organizes these fights?
<p><span class="tag">ZIGGY:</span> Officially, no one. But look hard, and you'll be surprised what you can
        find. It's a vibrant scene with winners and losers of all kinds. I
        promote fighters, place them in tournaments. Singled you out and
        venture to say you'll not regret that.
<p><span class="tag">ZIGGY:</span> Now, let's go where boys become men and brawlers become champions. The
        place reeks of blood, but come out standing and you'll sense the sweet
        smell of orens.

<p><span class="tag">GUARD:</span> Well that farmhand you brought in last time was carried out all broken
        in no time.
<p><span class="tag">ZIGGY:</span> This one will be different. You'll see. The Commandant himself will bet
        a fortune on him.
<p><span class="tag">GUARD:</span> All right, but if I'm to let him in he has to leave all his weapons here.

<p><span class="tag">ZIGGY:</span> Condone? He sets them up. A lot of coin at stake here. I haven't been
        too lucky lately, but I believe you'll change that. People will
        remember King Ziggy! Just don't disappoint me.

        known as Tassledick.
