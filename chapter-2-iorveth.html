<div class="dialogue">
<p><span class="tag">SASKIA:</span> Three thousand men – burned to ashes in minutes.
<p><span class="tag">STENNIS:</span> I remember the stillness when the news reached Vengerberg. The palace, the streets, the houses. The entire capital cloaked in silence.
<p><span class="tag">SASKIA:</span> The cries were here, every last man. I was somewhere beyond that hill... In the middle of the massacre.
<p><span class="tag">STENNIS:</span> What is your intention, Saskia?
<p><span class="tag">SASKIA:</span> I intend to stop Aedirn from being sold.
<p><span class="tag">STENNIS:</span> We cannot afford a war with Henselt. We must parley...
<p><span class="tag">SASKIA:</span> Leave issues of war to me, Prince. Concentrate on King Henselt. Yarpen Zigrin claims he's short-tempered. Provoke him to strike and we'll negotiate once the battle's won.
<p><span class="tag">STENNIS:</span> I still cannot fathom why the nobles betrayed us...
<p><span class="tag">SASKIA:</span> Spit on the nobles, Prince. They've meant nothing since the day my peasant force scattered them on the Dyphne.
<p><span class="tag">OLCAN:</span> By the good deity Kreve, m'Lord! The girl is a demon incarnate!
<p><span class="tag">STENNIS:</span> Firstly, the girl has a name. Secondly, she's the best commander I have – all others have betrayed me.
<p><span class="tag">OLCAN:</span> But she's a monster! Kreve spoke to me in a dream! I saw a snake-like she-demon devour your heritage!
<p><span class="tag">STENNIS:</span> Silence, Olcan. We near the meeting place.

<p><span class="tag">SOLDIER 1:</span>  The dragonslayer!

<p><span class="tag">STENNIS:</span> Greetings, Henselt. You seem at home in Aedirn. You are here, yet I do not recall inviting you.
<p><span class="tag">HENSELT:</span> Felart did so in your stead. I'm here at his behest. I've broken no truces or treaties – yet.
<p><span class="tag">STENNIS:</span> Oh, is that so? Mister Broghan, please escort Count Felart to a secluded spot and remove his troublesome head.
<p><span class="tag">FELART:</span> Don't you dare, boy. You're no king! Your father...
<p><span class="tag">STENNIS:</span> My father is dead. The folk still mourn him, while you betray his good name and his country!
<p><span class="tag">FELART:</span> Your Majesty, I must request your protection. This young man has lost his mind!
<p><span class="tag">STENNIS:</span> Take him away.
<p><span class="tag">FELART:</span> Your Majesty! What of our agreement?!
<p><span class="tag">HENSELT:</span> I need you no longer, Felart, now Stennis is here.

<div class="dialogue">
<p><span class="tag">STENNIS:</span> Anyone else wish to object? Wonderful! To the matter at hand, then.
<p><span class="tag">HENSELT:</span> Well said. I will show you my hand. I've over 200 armed men encamped nearby - enough to hold the ford for several hours. Another 5000 battle-hungry lads await on the other bank. What say you to that?

      <p><span class="tag">STENNIS:</span> This "piece of land" generates more revenue annually than all the forests of the great Kaedwen combined. Upper Aedirn is an ever-lasting pot of gold. Should I simply relinquish it? Or do you plan to make a purchase? Will you pay me with berries? Animal pelts? Will you send your armies into Kaedwen's woods to gather mushrooms?
      <p><span class="tag">HENSELT:</span> You're right. Better I send them to steal your pot of gold.

      <div class="dialogue">
      <p><span class="tag">STENNIS:</span> I'll not be intimidated, Henselt.
      <p><span class="tag">HENSELT:</span> Perhaps... Is it possible you merely play the courageous cockerel, yet deep inside fear eats at your heart? Is one push enough to send you over the edge? Or must I push twice?
      <p><span class="tag">STENNIS:</span> Try me!
      <p><span class="tag">HENSELT:</span> I tire of this discussion. I have the upper hand and no amount of scintillating talk will change that. We both know I'll not leave empty handed. What do you propose?

         <p><span class="tag">HENSELT:</span> You mock me? You think this is a game? You just talked yourself into a war, ya little shit.

<p><span class="tag">PHILIPPA:</span> You've all seen the magical phenomenon covering the battlefield. For any who still have doubts, this is no mundane mist, nor a petty fairground illusion. Most likely we are up against a blood curse, an old and powerful spell.
<p><span class="tag">PHILIPPA:</span> We do not know who cast it or why. For now I have one piece of good news and several pieces of bad news. The good news is that Henselt and his army have been halted for the time being.
<p><span class="tag">KALTEN:</span> And the bad news?
<p><span class="tag">PHILIPPA:</span> The mist will grow – it may even engulf Vergen. Furthermore, wraiths may emerge from it.
<p><span class="tag">YARPEN:</span> Can they be made penitent? With an axe to the head?
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> In theory, yes, but I would suggest putting your faith in a silver weapon. Furthermore, the ghosts will weaken as they move away from the mist.
<p><span class="tag">YARPEN:</span> Is there any way to drive it off? Exor-i-cise it?
<p><span class="tag">PHILIPPA:</span> A question for myself and Geralt of Rivia...
<p><span class="tag">KALTEN:</span> The kingslayer?
<p><span class="tag">PHILIPPA:</span> Contrary to what old women at the wells say, he did not, in fact, slay any kings.
<p><span class="tag">YARPEN:</span> Course he didn't. Wouldn't hurt a fly, that one. Look in his eyes - you'll see he's the sensitive kind.
<p><span class="tag">PHILIPPA:</span> Whatever you may see in his eyes, few know more about lifting curses. Gentlemen, I do not require you to understand this phenomenon, but there are a few rules I insist you must follow...
<p><span class="tag">ZOLTAN:</span> Here we go.
<p><span class="tag">PHILIPPA:</span> No one is to approach the mist. It is mortally dangerous. In addition, we need to learn the story of the battle. For this I especially count on the aid of Mr. Cecil Burdon.
<p><span class="tag">CECIL:</span> At your service, m'Lady.
<p><span class="tag">PHILIPPA:</span> Thank you. To lift the curse, we require some objects symbolic of the war. Ones belonging to those who perished here three years past.
<p><span class="tag">YARPEN:</span> Pfff! More scrap iron from that massacre lying about than lice in Cecil's beard. I thought curses were best handled with...
<p><span class="tag">PHILIPPA:</span> Please leave the thinking to me, Mister Zigrin. And I'd gladly hear less from you from now on. The objects must be magically active and strictly linked to the ghosts of the fallen. That is all.
<p><span class="tag">SASKIA:</span> Let me be clear - you're all to aid Philippa and the witcher. What are you grumbling about now, Yarpen?
<p><span class="tag">YARPEN:</span> Ah-hrgh... Somethin' in my gullet..
<p><span class="tag">SASKIA:</span> Take a swig of wine. Now, to worldly matters. How many are we?
<p><span class="tag">YARPEN:</span> Saskia, you know well...
<p><span class="tag">SASKIA:</span> How many?
<p><span class="tag">YARPEN:</span> We dwarves are near two hundred. But don't judge us by our number.
<p><span class="tag">KALTEN:</span> A half-thousand peasants will come, though you'll get no precise count.
<p><span class="tag">SASKIA:</span> Milords?
<p><span class="tag">NOBLE 1:</span> Fifty-three knights and another two hundred armed men. Not enough...
<p><span class="tag">SASKIA:</span> Henselt leads five thousand. Five to one against us. What think you of that?
<p><span class="tag">NOBLE 1:</span> We are few, they are many... But we have our walls, low though they be... If we had archers, who knows...
<p><span class="tag">YARPEN:</span> Oh, for a regiment of heavy arbalists from Lyria...
<p><span class="tag">SASKIA:</span> We have something better. Iorveth's elves. Scoia'tael.

<p><span class="tag">KALTEN:</span> What do you seek here, murderer?!

<p><span class="tag">IORVETH:</span> Saskia, say the word and we'll depart.
<p><span class="tag">SASKIA:</span> Hear me out. Iorveth came to fight for me. I trust him and I know that he'll stay the course. Just like each of you.
<p><span class="tag">KALTEN:</span> How could you know that? He's an elf! Treason runs in his veins...
<p><span class="tag">NOBLE 1:</span> He's been fighting humans for a century!
<p><span class="tag">SASKIA:</span> But for the first time in scores of years his fight makes sense. The Scoia'tael know no peace, they've died for Nilfgaard, for the Valley of the Flowers – in vain. They've been betrayed and cheated. Now they have a new goal. The Pontar Valley could be the first state where no man would have to fear elven arrows when venturing beyond city walls, and elves and dwarves wouldn't live in ghettos or on reservations.
<p><span class="tag">SASKIA:</span> First, however, we have a battle to win. You know who we're up against. It's a splendid army, brave and well led. They cannot be scared off or routed. They have to be killed. I want Iorveth to sit at the same table as we do. I want him to kill Kaedweni for us. And I assure you that he'll do so with a smile, if only you let him.
<p><span class="tag">YARPEN:</span> If I'm to see a smile on that skinny face... I'm in. Iorveth stays.
<p><span class="tag">KALTEN:</span> Bloody hell! Father's turning in his grave, but a must's a must. I say aye.
<p><span class="tag">STENNIS:</span> Nay.
<p><span class="tag">NOBLE 3:</span> You killed my men, elf. Remember them?
<p><span class="tag">IORVETH:</span> If I hadn't killed them, they'd have killed me.
<p><span class="tag">NOBLE 3:</span> All right, for the sake of better times and for Kaedwen's doom! Aye!
<p><span class="tag">ZOLTAN:</span> Down with the sons of bitches! Cheers!

Kings issue from ancient dynasties. Over the ages, to survive, rulers needed exceptional resistance and strength. As royal dynasties rarely admit common blood, the strength of their genes remains great.

      <p><span class="tag">PHILIPPA:</span> Well, well... I'm impressed.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Thing is, until now I thought it was only a myth, that such a curse couldn't be cast.
      <p><span class="tag">PHILIPPA:</span> You thought wrong. There are six confirmed cases of this curse being inflicted.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> What about confirmed cases of it being lifted?
      <p><span class="tag">PHILIPPA:</span> One. Achieved by a team of sorcerers led by Arch Mistress Francesca Findabair - hence the curse's other name. Sabrina Glevissig was on the team...
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Small world.
      <p><span class="tag">PHILIPPA:</span> That's not all. The curse investigated by Francesca and Sabrina was designed to end the Thyssen dynasty, the rulers of Kovir. They were cursed by Scarlet Rodallega, a complete madman, but very talented. An eclipse and wraiths also accompanied his curse.
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> So, Sabrina's curse is just a knock-off Rodallega.

<div class="dialogue">
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Did you fight at Brenna?
<p><span class="tag">YARPEN:</span> Ah, fuck, I knows you've got amnesia, but you coulda remembered that!
<p><span class="tag">YARPEN:</span> Ah, it was a beautiful day. On one side, six and forty thousand Black Ones - on the other, us, the Nordlings together. The Redanians led by De Ruyter on the left, the Temerian regiments in the middle... And us on the right, the Mahakam Volunteer Army - all dwarves. Even the likes of Coehoorn must've shit his britches at the sight of us.
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> He hardly lacked courage, as I heard it.
<p><span class="tag">YARPEN:</span> A right brave bastard, that's true. Preferred to die than run like a rat. I don't believe I've ever seen a bigger melee, except maybe three years ago, here at Vergen. We'd have managed that day, too, even without the magic - that burning shit that fell from the sky. Why, even the Dun Banner knelt before us when we brought our battleaxes down.
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Some say not one of the Dun Banner survived. Any truth to that?
<p><span class="tag">YARPEN:</span> Biggerhorn nabbed the survivors as they fled south, but most men of the Banner lie in the catacombs - along with their standard. The Dun Banner - what the hell kind of name is that for a unit anyway? It's as if they couldn't get their fuckin' flag clean.
</div>

<p class="stage">[Stennis also has some information about the battle.]</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I'm trying to figure out where this fog came from. What exactly happened here three years ago?
<p><span class="tag">STENNIS:</span> Henselt's mages committed mass murder. A dark day for the knighthood and all people of honor. But it was honor that allowed us to survive. There was no defeat, no victory. Honor stood against wickedness. Virtue against black magic.
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> You took part in that battle?
<p><span class="tag">STENNIS:</span> My father stayed in the capital. He was to defend Vengerberg. I took to the field. I wanted to stop Henselt before he crossed the Pontar, but I was too late. So I decided to await him at Vergen.
<p><span class="tag">STENNIS:</span> Henselt's army was exhausted. We would have triumphed, if not for that heinous act. Henselt had mages with him, and they cast a treacherous spell on the entire battlefield. A fiery rain fell from the heavens - destructive, murderous embers which brought the battle to an end. I gathered the few survivors and withdrew deep into the country. The soldiers were terrified, but Henselt showed no desire to pursue.

   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Not the best analogy.

   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Only a master mage could've cast such a powerful spell. And I suspect he could not have accomplished it alone.
   <p><span class="tag">STENNIS:</span> I remember Sabrina Glevissig. Through the flames I saw her observing the carnage from her mount, dressed in a hunting suit - straight-backed, dispassionate.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Sabrina... If I remember correctly, she's Henselt's advisor.
   <p><span class="tag">STENNIS:</span> Was. Henselt condemned her to death for casting that spell. The Kaedwenis roasted in their armor just the same way the Aedirnians did. You know what struck me when all hell broke loose, what I found astonishing and even amusing?
   <p><span class="tag">STENNIS:</span> Going into battle we sang our Aedirnian songs. They intoned their Kaedweni hymns to Kreve. But when fire descended from the sky, our cries of pain were no different. We all wailed as humans. For an instant, the magnitude of the tragedy brought together our two warring nations.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I still have no idea where the spectral fog came from.

<p class="stage">[Finally, Geralt can go speak to Cecil.]</p>

<div class="dialogue">
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Cecil, do you know anyone who fought in the war three years ago?
<p><span class="tag">CECIL:</span> I did.
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Did you fight here at Vergen?
<p><span class="tag">CECIL:</span> Course.
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Philippa claims you know a bit about the battle?
<p><span class="tag">CECIL:</span> That old kook Henselt, called king by some, thought that Aedirnians were bumpkins who'd shit bricks as soon as his troops crossed the river.
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Why did he attack Aedirn?
<p><span class="tag">CECIL:</span> According to Henselt, Upper Aedirn is the ancient legacy of the Kaedweni crown and must be returned to the mother country. Brazen farter.
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> That brazen farter had a point. If you read some history, you'll know that three hundred years ago this land belonged to Kaedwen.
<p><span class="tag">CECIL:</span> Load of crap! Seven hundred years ago the elves reigned here! And a million years ago these lands were the domain of the worms! If things worked that way, every king could invade a neighboring land and claim his right to do so because an ancestor took a dump there!
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> All right... Henselt wanted to conquer Upper Aedirn. What then?
<p><span class="tag">CECIL:</span> He rolled in, got hammered, and rolled out.
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Cecil, that doesn't help me much...
<p><span class="tag">CECIL:</span> It wasn't a battle, it was a slaughter. If I try speaking of it, I'll see it all again... I don't want...
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> The ghosts of the fallen fight in the mist. They turn into horrible creatures called draugirs. Aedirnians, Kaedweni... men, elves... And dwarves too.
<p><span class="tag">CECIL:</span> Bloody hell. No peace even after death.
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I want to help them. But I need to know more about the battle.
<p><span class="tag">CECIL:</span> Very well, listen...
<p><span class="tag">CECIL:</span> A beautiful day... that grew hot later. Very hot. When Vandergrift attacked in the afternoon, he sent the Dun Banner at the fore. Many of our lads shit themselves at the mere sight of their standard. But we had a surprise of our own. Under the cover of night we'd prepared fire pits. Our archers lit them up at the right moment. I still can't believe we managed to fool their scouts. If it wasn't for that ambush, we wouldn't be speaking today. There likely wouldn't be an Upper Aedirn at all.
<p><span class="tag">CECIL:</span> We decimated the Dun Banner, but that was only the beginning. Seltkirk was our commander. Everywhere he appeared, the Kaedwenis gave ground. He wreaked havoc among them. Hearts rose at the mere sight of his armor. Then Vandergrift himself entered the fray. Seltkirk met him in the middle of the field. In the end, Vandergrift killed Seltkirk. A terrible death that sent the Aedirnian ranks into disarray.
<p><span class="tag">CECIL:</span> I thought it was the end of us... Then the sky fell. As if the stars themselves had decided to avenge the death of a great knight. Fire covered the battlefield. Nobody sought the enemy. They were all looking for somewhere to flee.
<p><span class="tag">CECIL:</span> Yeees... There were no more friends and enemies, only the living and the dead. They say it was the doing of a Kaedweni sorceress who wanted revenge on Vandergrift. Could be true, as Henselt had her executed right after the battle.
</div>

<div class="indent">
   <div class="choice"><span>How did the battle start?
   </span></div>
   <div class="dialogue">
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Remember anything from before the battle?
   <p><span class="tag">CECIL:</span> As if it was yesterday. Henselt's troops crossed the Pontar the third day after the autumn equinox. Aedirn had good spies, so we were ready for them, and Seltkirk lined up our troops along the hills.
   <p><span class="tag">CECIL:</span> Our hearts rose at the sight of the banners of Vengerberg, Aldersberg and Gulet fluttering in the wind... Knights and armored infantry side by side in our ranks... Even the peasants had their regiments. The dwarves were on the left flank. Over five thousand strong we were. Nobody caring about race or background. Like never before. Only King Demavend was missing. But he must have had more important business than defending his country.

   <div class="choice"><span>Did you see the Kaedwenis cross?
   </span></div>
   <div class="dialogue">
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> You saw the Kaedwenis cross the river?
   <p><span class="tag">CECIL:</span> From afar. I saw Vandergrift leading four thousand heavily armed men. Many a heart sank when we saw the elite Bear Heads or the armored banners from Ard Carraigh. The Dun Banner was in the middle - veterans of Brenna.
   <p><span class="tag">CECIL:</span> As soon as he set foot on Aedirnian land, Vandergrift climbed a hill and surveyed the area, as if it was his fief. Son of a bitch was as sure of himself as ever. Upon spying him, I remember the dwarves all dropped their trousers and showed him their arses.
   <p><span class="tag">CECIL:</span> Then Seltkirk stepped out in front of us. His white armor shone in the sun. We were afraid a Kaedweni arbalist would shoot him, but they, too, stood as if frozen. And Seltkirk just looked at them and bowed ever so slightly.
   </div>

   </span></div>
   <div class="dialogue">
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Did you see the duel between Seltkirk and Vandergrift?
   <p><span class="tag">CECIL:</span> I stood half a furlong from them. Never seen a fight like it. Probably never will again.
   <p><span class="tag">CECIL:</span> They'd already met once. At a jousting tournament in Ard Carraigh. Seltkirk won there. He beat on The Visitor so hard he broke his sword. Seltkirk was a true knight, the last of his breed. Vandergrift was so pissed off after that tournament he hanged the smith who made his sword and ordered a special one, from a sorcerer. I bet he cut down Seltkirk with that new sword.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Vandergrift is dead. What happened to his sword?
   <p><span class="tag">CECIL:</span> Saskia's got it. Good thing, too. Only her hand can tame the hatred enchanted in that sword. After the battle, when the flames abated, the scavengers came. They stole everything. Imagine - not a single keepsake of Seltkirk in the whole of Aedirn. His brother babbled something about a gauntlet, but he's a lying dog.

   <div class="choice"><span>What happened to the Dun Banner?
   </span></div>
   <div class="dialogue">
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> You captured the Dun Banner's standard?
   <p><span class="tag">CECIL:</span> Henselt's choice troops and not a one survived. The Visitor sent them to their deaths. Refused to give them reinforcements. He was a monster in human form. The men of the Dun were real swaggerers. Killed a lot of our lads, but for every Dunner there were seven Aedirnians... They had no chance.
   <p><span class="tag">CECIL:</span> Aye, we captured their standard. We buried what was left of them in the crypts beyond Vergen. Their standard lies with them. Worthy foes are to be respected, even in death.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I'm going to need that standard.

   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Thanks. Cecil, that was helpful. I think I know what I need to lift the curse now.
   <p><span class="tag">CECIL:</span> Madame Eilhart claims you need four symbols... The standard symbolizes death, Vandergrift's sword stands for hatred. What about the other two...?
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I have a feeling Philippa has a handle on the rest.

<p><span class="tag">SILGRAT:</span> A peasant servant claims that Prince Stennis supposedly attempted
        to kill Saskia. Why would the prince do such a dastardly deed?! Bear

<p><span class="tag">KALTEN:</span> That's why! The mongrel covets the crown!
<p><span class="tag">SILGRAT:</span> Do you even remember how valorous he was towards Saskia during the

        fact that servants taste wine from the barrels before the Virgin sips
        it!
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> No need to poison the wine. Smearing the poison inside the chalice
        would be enough.
<p><span class="tag">SILGRAT:</span> I never heard of anyone poisoning a chalice.
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> You haven't heard much, then. One of the emperor's forebears died after
        sampling some lamb. He was always scared of poison and ate supper with
        his cook. The murderer spread poison on one side of a knife. Then he
        cut the meat so that only a small piece was poisoned.
<p><span class="tag">KALTEN:</span> The witcher's right! Give us Stennis!
<p><span class="tag">SILGRAT:</span> Saskia's got her own chalice!

        Never! It's 'cause of her you noble dogs can't ignore us! A pig won't

        they wanted, nobody but Stennis could do it.
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> You're wrong, Kalten. Reverend Olcan wanted to get rid of Saskia. He
        thought she was a monster at heart.
<p><span class="tag">KALTEN:</span> Olcan was on Stennis' leash, like a dog.
<p><span class="tag">SILGRAT:</span> How dare you, lout! Do you imagine if someone sits next to a married
        lady he's surely fucking her?
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> The priest tried to convince Prince Stennis to join the conspiracy.
<p><span class="tag">KALTEN:</span> Is Stennis some dimwit foundling that he dances to a lousy priest's
        tune?! Olcan got what he deserved when Henselt cleaved his head. Now
        it's Stennis's time!
<p><span class="tag">SILGRAT:</span> There is no proof the prince agreed!

   chance. I'm tired.

   February 24, 1270 – A high pass in the Armush Mountains. An imperial
   manticore – one of the world’s oldest and deadliest monsters. I used to feel
   excitement at moments like this, now the beast is only an obstacle on my
   way. Its meat and hot blood will help me survive this icy hell.
   <div class="narbreak">&nbsp;</div>
   May 30, 1270 – The Yaruga River. The Hunt continues to race south. Since

   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I'd like to say I'm doing it for you, for a cause... But the truth is far less lofty. A certain elf prophesied that I'd recover my memory during this battle.
   <p><span class="tag">SASKIA:</span> I had no idea you believed in prophecies.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I don't. But I also don't have a choice. I need to try. If my amnesia was magically induced, the elf's prophecy is just common sense.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> When I lift the curse, a shock wave will roll across the battlefield, a wave of pure, uncontrolled Power looking for an outlet. As soon as it finds one, a strong field of antimagic will arise. Who knows what might happen to someone subjected to these extreme conditions, but something's gotta give. I'm fresh out of alternatives.</div>

   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> No, not bloodthirsty enough. Speaking of which... ever stopped to wonder that all your commanders are natural born killers?
   <p><span class="tag">SASKIA:</span> It has crossed my mind. The truth is, many find peace far harder to bear than war.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Can I ask you a personal question?
   <p><span class="tag">SASKIA:</span> Mhm.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> How did you get caught up in this?
   <p><span class="tag">SASKIA:</span> It's the way I was raised. I should say, it's how my father raised me. My mother died in childbirth. I knew my father – or at least, bits and pieces of him. He was a little like you – never wore out his welcome...
   <p><span class="tag">SASKIA:</span> But he did succeed in teaching me two things: honor, and how to be free. My choice was to spit on those ideals or to fight.</div>

<div class="dialogue">
<p><span class="tag">IORVETH:</span> What is it?
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> A tome of potion recipes.
<p><span class="tag">IORVETH:</span> We've no time to read books.
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Sorceresses carefully guard books like this.
<p><span class="tag">IORVETH:</span> Not that carefully. After all, she left it behind.
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> She was in a hurry.
<p><span class="tag">IORVETH:</span> Could this book have anything to do with the Dragonslayer?

   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Even if it doesn't, it's still very valuable.
   <p><span class="tag">IORVETH:</span> I'm sure it's filled with recipes Eilhart used to send many to eternity.

   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Most things in this land seem to have something to do with Saskia, the dragon.
   <p><span class="tag">IORVETH:</span> How do you know?

   <p><span class="tag">IORVETH:</span> Then keep your mouth shut, Gwynbleidd, because if...

<div class="dialogue">
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I've found thaumador's recipe.
<p><span class="tag">IORVETH:</span> Eilhart already told us the ingredients for magepain. How is it relevant?
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Usually, the recipe for an antidote is right next to the one for the poison.
<p><span class="tag">IORVETH:</span> I can recite it exactly. Royal blood, an immortelle, a dragon's dream and petals from a rose of remembrance.
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Yet this book doesn't even mention a rose of remembrance.
<p><span class="tag">IORVETH:</span> I recall perfectly that Eilhart said a rose of remembrance, combined with an immortelle, heals the mind.
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> What if she lied? Maybe it doesn't heal the mind but influences it. Philippa passed the flower to Saskia through a kiss - the symbol of love and perdition.
<p><span class="tag">IORVETH:</span> I'm confused.
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I think Philippa subjugated Saskia's mind by adding the rose to the antidote.
<p><span class="tag">IORVETH:</span> I'll kill that bitch.
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Philippa has magic and an obedient dragon at her command. She could have a strong influence on the conference.
<p><span class="tag">IORVETH:</span> But what does she want?
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> We can only learn that in Loc Muinne.

<div class="stage">[DANDELION, NARRATING: Síle de Tansarville! I'd sensed from the start that some dark 
   mystery lay behind that cold countenance...
   <div class="narbreak">&nbsp;</div>
   Following the demise of the Council and Conclave, there was no one left to keep the mages in line, but regicide? Why? What was this all about? It seemed these questions would be answered at Loc Muinne... an ancient city amidst mountains, the remnants of the civilization of the Vrans, whose dusk had come long ago.
   <div class="narbreak">&nbsp;</div>
   And you would be right to ask, "Why did you not set out for Loc Muinne, Master Dandelion?" Vergen was free. Yet what is freedom without its awareness? It might too easily pass from hand to hand were a nation to lack individuals capable of pointing the way. I remained in the Pontar Valley. That is the task Fate seemed to assign me - to safeguard freedom as it budded and bloomed.
   <div class="narbreak">&nbsp;</div>
   Yet forever feeling a vast, shared responsbiilty for the fate of the North, I dispatched to Loc Muinne my faithful and capable friend, Geralt of Rivia. Have I mentioned his disdain for politics? Well, it was at Loc Muinne where he could finally give vent to it.]</div>
