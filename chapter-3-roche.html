   <p><span class="tag">COMMANDER:</span> Temeria cannot survive... the kingdom will be divided - the nobles are riled, Constable Natalis stands on shaky ground.</p>
   <p><span class="tag">DETHMOLD:</span> Loyal old Natalis will get kicked in the arse. How predictable.</p>
   <p><span class="tag">COMMANDER:</span> They nearly reached an agreement, but without Foltest's daughter it didn't work out.</p>

   <p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> Oh, bollocks, Geralt. Marshal Raupenneck was a cruel, bloodthirsty prick, true - but the times were different.</p>
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> He had his men murder every last elf in Loc Muinne...</p>
   <p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> For years, Iorveth and his ilk have been using that banner to wipe their arses clean of the shit they do. In wartime, a commander's forced to make all kinds of decisions - it's as simple as that.</p>
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Yeah, and I'm sure it lay really heavily on Raupenneck's conscience.</p>
   <p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> Bollocks, again. I've already admitted he was a prick. Are you defending the Aen Seidhe? They've got barrels of blood on their hands as well.</p>
   <p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> "With the Vrans gone, we had to safeguard this source of the Power, safeguard this historic city." Hah, elven drivel. Heaps of lizard-like bones were found in nearby caves - all bearing traces of sword cuts. Ah, think what you will, I'm more interested in the city's current inhabitants.</p>
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Why am I worried you're going to do something really stupid once we get there?</p>

      <p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> He didn't believe I'd do it till the very end. Nor did I. It's not something I want to discuss again. I don't know if I'll ever strike those images from my mind, but I know I don't want to talk about it.</p>
      <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Taking revenge on Dethmold won't change a thing.</p>

   <p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> The Blue Stripes were more than a fighting force. I selected and trained those men myself. True, there were good days and bad... But they weren't even given the chance to die in combat.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> You also lost your king, Vernon. Don't forget why you embarked on this mission.</p>

         should be organized if those mages from the Conclave have any sense.</p>
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Ah, another area of your expertise.</p>
   <p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> The Peace of Cintra was signed on April 2nd, and all around was quiet,
         calm and orderly - if you don't count Henselt's roars and the all-night
         festivities of the Mahakam Volunteer Army.</p>
   <p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> And the common folk were positively thrilled with the parade that
         followed. Yet not one of those fuckers even knew that I, and a few
         others like me, spent a week poring over the city map and devising a
         way to keep those crowned idiots separate. Just in case one decided to
         deal the next blow in a long-standing feud.</p>
   <p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> Uh, in any case, I hope to see something similar here.</p>
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Relax, the mages want royal gold. They'll make sure all the sources of
         financing remain alive and present, at least until the inevitable
         quarrel over the Pontar Valley breaks out.</p>
   <p><span class="tag">ROCHE:</span> Well, we'll see if there's indeed a way where there's a will. If we're

   <p><span class="tag">BRIGIDA:</span> We were travelling along the agreed path, with a limited escort so
           as not to draw attention. The children were in two separate wagons -
           a safety measure, I was told.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Which one were you in?
   <p><span class="tag">BRIGIDA:</span> I was with Anaïs. One day a messenger appeared with orders for the
           caravan's commander. A change of plans. We turned north to travel a
           longer route for safety's sake. Soon after the turn-off, we were
           attacked.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Hm.
   <p><span class="tag">BRIGIDA:</span> The attackers were killing everyone indiscriminately. One pulled
           me from the wagon, but a bolt pierced his neck. It was mayhem. I
           ran for the bushes and hid.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Did you see what happened to the children?
   <p><span class="tag">BRIGIDA:</span> The driver of Boussy's wagon was shot. The horses got spooked and
           ran off into the forest, taking the wagon with them. When the
           fighting was done, they found Anaïs, still in her wagon. I turned
           away for fear of what they might do, but they merely grabbed her
           and fled.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Any idea what happened to the caravan commander's orders?
   <p><span class="tag">BRIGIDA:</span> I have them. After they took Anaïs, the bastards were in a hurry.
           They didn't even think to search the corpses. Take them.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Thanks. Sure you can manage that boat?
   <p><span class="tag">BRIGIDA:</span> I must. I'll not return to the city. Thank you again, witcher. And

              venture a guess - Maravel entrusts his correspondence to a mage.
      <p><span class="tag">KIMBOLT:</span> I knew you were suited to this task. The magic barrier placed
              over the city mutes all forms of high magic, preventing Lash

   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Surprising? How so?
   <p><span class="tag">MARAVEL:</span> Surely you jest, witcher. Truth be told, few could marshal loyal
           forces matching mine on such short order - Baron Kimbolt excepted.
           Yet though I very much held Foltest's trust, I cannot say that many
           of my Temerian peers feel the same way.

   <p><span class="tag">MARAVEL:</span> I know her, I have known her, and I expect I yet will. And I'm not
           alone in that. Though mind you - I admire the woman. Her kind of
           ambition is rare, among both genders.
   <p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Ever taken advantage of that? Ever asked her to run errands for you?
   <p><span class="tag">MARAVEL:</span> One must be careful with the ambitious. They are almost always
           running their own errands. Asking them to do yours simply invites
           them to use you. Baron Kimbolt learned that the hard way. But why
           ask me about the lass? Here and now, of all times and places.
           Surely, given your close allegiance and, no doubt, many a shared

<p><span class="tag">CARDUIN:</span> The more important question relates to the Conclave and its power to
        designate royal advisors. Today, randomly chosen mages and sorceresses
        reside at many courts. However, in the time of the previous Conclave,
        such persons were carefully chosen.

        prosperity of the Northern Kingdoms. The document has been signed by

<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Where is he?
<p><span class="tag">SÍLE:</span> I don't know, fool! I've been looking for him since Foltest's
        assassination. Letho cheated all of us, we were deceived by his dull
        face and sluggish stare. Don't you understand?! The Lodge sought a way
        to get rid of Demavend, that's true. He was a weak, volatile king -
        Aedirn would eventually choke to death under his rule. We chose the
        lesser evil - he had to be eliminated, and Letho happened to be "at
        hand."
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Foltest? Henselt?
<p><span class="tag">SÍLE:</span> We had nothing to do with that. After assassinating Demavend, Letho
        used our gold and magical support to find and meet Iorveth. The elf
        was to help him hide until the matter blew over. Or so I thought. The
        Lodge did not condemn Foltest to die.
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Then who did?
<p><span class="tag">SÍLE:</span> Nilfgaard. Letho is the king of liars and emperor of traitors! From
        the start he worked for the glory of the Great Sun and the White Flame
        Dancing on the Graves of His Foes. He lied to everyone. Me, Iorveth,
        your stupid little Triss... And you.
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Got any evidence?
<p><span class="tag">SÍLE:</span> A moment ago I received a message from the Lodge's agent in Cintra.
        The Imperial army is on the move. They're fording the Yaruga now. Do
        you think the North can defend itself in the current situation? Can
        you count on another miracle at Brenna?
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I don't know... But you made it all possible and you'll answer for
        that. The stigma of treason is yours - for all time.
<p><span class="tag">SÍLE:</span> We shall see, for no one will leave this city alive. No one will tell
        this story. Philippa controls the dragon. As soon as I disappear, it
        will turn the city into a flaming tomb.
<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> The dragon attacked Foltest's troops during the siege of La Valette
        Castle. That hardly supports your tale.
<p><span class="tag">SÍLE:</span> We did not control it then. We may have lost a battle, but the war is
