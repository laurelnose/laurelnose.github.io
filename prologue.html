   nature and are known by the name of witcher, as they are the offspring of
   foul sorcery and witchcraft. Unscrupulous scoundrels without conscience and
   virtue, they are veritable creatures from hell, capable only of taking
   lives...

 Six years have passed since that memorable day when the Northern Kingdoms,
   their forces united, defeated the hosts of Nilfgaard in open battle at
   Brenna.
   <div style="margin: 0; font-size: .35em">&nbsp;</div>
   Famine and disease reign in all the North. Elves and dwarves inhabit ghettos.
   In ever increasing numbers, they flee to the forests to join Scoia'tael
   units.
   <div style="margin: 0; font-size: .35em">&nbsp;</div>
   In Temeria, an unidentified assassin attempts to murder King Foltest. The
   killer dies at the hands of Geralt of Rivia, a professional monster slayer.
   <div style="margin: 0; font-size: .35em">&nbsp;</div>
   A month passes. On the banks of the Pontar River, Foltest's army is
   victorious once more, ending civil strife in the country. Yet the price of
   this triumph proves immense.]</div>

<p class="stage">[Geralt runs through a forest in the dark and the rain, while voices call out
   his name. He finally collapses into unconsciousness. We see Lambert and
   Berengar running towards his fallen body, while someone laughs in the
   distance.]</p>
